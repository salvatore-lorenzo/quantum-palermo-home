      abstract={We present a realistic implementation of a quantum engine powered by a phaseonium gas of coherently prepared three-level atoms -- where quantum coherence acts as a thermodynamic resource. Using a collision model framework for phaseonium-cavity interactions and cavity optomechanics, we construct a full engine cycle based on two non-thermal reservoirs, each characterized by coherence-induced effective temperatures. This configuration enhances the efficiency of a simple optomechanical engine operating beyond standard thermal paradigms. We further address scalability by coupling a second cavity in cascade configuration, where the same phaseonium gas drives both cycles. Our results demonstrate the operational viability of coherence-driven quantum engines and their potential for future thermodynamic applications.},

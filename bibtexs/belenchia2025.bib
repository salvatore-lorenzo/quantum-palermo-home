    abstract = {Newton's constant is the least well-measured among the fundamental constants of Nature, and, indeed, its accurate measurement has long served an experimental challenge. Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation of Newtonâ€™s constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several orders of magnitude.},

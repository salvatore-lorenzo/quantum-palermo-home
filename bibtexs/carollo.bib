abstract={As light can mediate interactions between atoms in a photonic environment,engineering it for endowing the photon-mediated Hamiltonian with desiredfeatures, like robustness against disorder, is crucial in quantum research. Weprovide general theorems on the topology of photon-mediated interactions interms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological invariants, unveilingthe phenomena of topological preservation and reversal, and revealing asystem-bath topological correspondence. Depending on the Hermiticity of theenvironment and the parity of the spatial dimension, the atomic and photonictopological invariants turn out to be equal or opposite. Consequently, theemergence of atomic and photonic topological boundary modes with oppo-site group velocities in two-dimensional Hermitian topological systems isestablished. Owing to its general applicability, our results can guide the designof topological systems.},

abstract = {Noisy and ac forcing can cooperatively lead to the emergence of sine-Gordon breathers robust to dissipation. This phenomenon is studied, for both Neumann and periodic boundary conditions, at different values of the main system parameters, such as the noise intensity and the ac frequency-amplitude pair. In all the considered cases, nonmonotonicities of the probability of generating only breathers versus the noise strength are observed, implying that optimal noise ranges for the breather formation process exist. Within the latter scenarios, the statistics of the breathers’ number, position, and amplitude are analyzed. The number of breathers is found to grow, on average, with the noise amplitude. The breathers’ spatial distribution is sharply peaked at the system's edges for Neumann boundary conditions, whereas it is essentially uniform for periodic boundary conditions. The average breather amplitude is dictated by the ac frequency-amplitude pair. Finally, a size analysis shows that the minimum system length for the generation mechanism is given by the typical breather half-width (width) in the case of Neumann boundary conditions (periodic boundary conditions). © 2023 The Author(s)},

abstract={We present a general framework to tackle quantum optics problems with giant atoms, i.e. quantum emitters each coupled {\it non-locally} to a structured photonic bath (typically a lattice) of any dimension. The theory encompasses the calculation and general properties of Green's functions, atom-photon bound states (BSs), collective master equations and decoherence-free Hamiltonians (DFHs), and is underpinned by a formalism where a giant atom is formally viewed as a normal atom lying at a fictitious location. As a major application, we provide for the first time a general criterion to predict/engineer DFHs of giant atoms, which can be applied both in and out of the photonic continuum and regardless of the structure or dimensionality of the photonic bath. This is used to show novel DFHs in 2D baths such as a square lattice and photonic graphene},

abstract{Non-Hermitian physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique topological features such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as probes for bulk Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity reaching Heisenberg scaling. Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral topological phase transition, where the entire spectrum undergoes a delocalization transition. We provide an explanation for this enhanced sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely non-Hermitian energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a direct connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the non-Hermitian realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic non-Hermitian topological models in various dimensions and potential experimental implementations},

abstract={Measurement-induced phase transition arises from the competition between a deterministic quantum evolution and a repeated measurement process. We explore the measurement-induced phase transition through the Quantum Fisher Information in two different metrological scenarios. We demonstrate through the scaling behavior of the quantum Fisher information the transition of the multi-partite entanglement across the phases. In analogy with standard quantum phase transition, we reveal signature of a measurement-induced phase transition in the non-analytic behaviour of the quantum Fisher information as the measurement strength approaches the critical value. Our results offer novel insights into the features of a quantum systems undergoing measurement-induced phase transition and indicate potential avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum physics.},

abstract = {The dynamics of sine-Gordon breathers is studied in the presence of dissipative and stochastic perturbations. Taking a stationary breather with a random phase value as the initial state, the simulations demonstrate that a spatially-homogeneous noisy source can make the oscillatory excitation more stable, i.e., it enables the latter to last significantly longer than it would in a noise-free scenario. Both the frequency domain and the localization of energy are examined to illustrate the effectiveness of the noise-enhanced stability phenomenon, which manifests itself as a nonmonotonic behavior of the mean first-passage time for the breather as a function of the noise intensity. The influence of the mode's initial frequency on the results and their robustness against an additional thermal background are also addressed. Overall, the analysis highlights a counter-intuitive, positive role of noise in the breather's persistence.},

abstract = {Single parameter estimation is known to benefit from extreme sensitivity to parameter changes in quantum critical systems. However, the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters is generally limited due to the incompatibility arising from the quantum nature of the underlying system. A key question is whether quantum criticality may also play a positive role in reducing the incompatibility in the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. We argue that this is generally the case and verify this prediction in paradigmatic quantum many-body systems close to first and second order phase transitions. The antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic 1-D Ising chain with both transverse and longitudinal fields are analysed across different regimes and close to criticality.},

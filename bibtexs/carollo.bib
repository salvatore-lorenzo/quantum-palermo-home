We validate our theoretical model by experiments carried out on a memristive device based on multilayer structure. In the framework of the proposed model we obtain the exact analytic expressions for stationary and nonstationary solutions. We analyze the equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady-state distributions of the internal state variable of the memristive system and study the influence of fluctuations on the resistive switching, including the relaxation time to the steady-state. The relaxation time shows a nonmonotonic dependence, with a minimum, on the intensity of the fluctuations. This paves the way for using the intensity of fluctuations as a control parameter for switching dynamics in memristive devices.},

The noise-induced transient bimodality phenomenon, arising under resistive switching, was revealed and investigated theoretically and experimentally in a memristive system, by finding a quite good qualitatively agreement between theory and experiment.

After a pedagogical introduction to geometric phases and geometric information in the characterisation of quantum phase transitions, we describe recent developments of geometrical approaches based on mixed-state generalisation of the Berry-phase, i.e. the Uhlmann geometric phase, for the investigation of non-equilibrium steady-state quantum phase transitions (NESS-QPTs ). Equilibrium phase transitions fall invariably into two markedly non-overlapping categories: classical phase transitions and quantum phase transitions, whereas in NESS-QPTs this distinction may fade off. The approach described in this review, among other things, can quantitatively assess the quantum character of such critical phenomena. This framework is applied to a paradigmatic class of lattice Fermion systems with local reservoirs, characterised by Gaussian non-equilibrium steady states. The relations between the behaviour of the geometric phase curvature, the divergence of the correlation length, the character of the criticality and the gap -- either Hamiltonian or dissipative -- are reviewed.},

Here these are incorporated in a general framework (not relying on master equations) and contrasted to dispersive DF Hamiltonians with normal atoms: the two schemes are shown to correspond to qualitatively different ways to match the same general condition for suppressing decoherence. Next, we map the giant atoms dynamics into a cascaded collision model (CM), providing an intuitive interpretation of the connection between nontrivial DF Hamiltonians and coupling points topology. The braided configuration is shown to implement a scheme where a shuttling system subject to periodic phase kicks mediates a DF coupling between the atoms. From the viewpoint of CMs theory, this shows a collision model where ancillas effectively implement a dissipationless, maximally entangling two-qubit gate on the system.},

In the regime of negligible delays, the unitary describing each collision in particular features a contribution of a chiral origin resulting in an effective Hamiltonian. The picture is applied to derive a Lindblad master equation (ME) of a set of giant atoms coupled to a (generally chiral) waveguide field in an arbitrary white-noise Gaussian state, which condenses into a single equation and extends a variety of quantum optics and waveguide QED MEs.

We show that the desired biasing is achieved by suitably modifying the Kraus operators describing the discrete open system dynamics. From a microscopical viewpoint and for short collision times, this corresponds to adding extra collisions which enforce the system to follow a desired rare trajectory. The above extends the theory of biased quantum trajectories from Lindblad-like dynamics to sequences of arbitrary dynamical maps, providing at once a transparent physical interpretation.},

This phenomenon is studied, for both Neumann and periodic boundary conditions, at different values of the main system parameters, such as the noise intensity and the ac frequency-amplitude pair. In all the considered cases, nonmonotonicities of the probability of generating only breathers versus the noise strength are observed, implying that optimal noise ranges for the breather formation process exist. Within the latter scenarios, the statistics of the breathers' number, position, and amplitude are analyzed. The number of breathers is found to grow, on average, with the noise amplitude. The breathers' spatial distribution is sharply peaked at the system's edges for Neumann boundary conditions, whereas it is essentially uniform for periodic boundary conditions. The average breather amplitude is dictated by the ac frequency-amplitude pair. Finally, a size analysis shows that the minimum system length for the generation mechanism is given by the typical breather half-width (width) in the case of Neumann boundary conditions (periodic boundary conditions).},

Both the frequency domain and the localization of energy are examined to illustrate the effectiveness of the noise-enhanced stability phenomenon, which manifests itself as a nonmonotonic behavior of the mean first-passage time for the breather as a function of the noise intensity.

  abstract = {The stochastic resonance phenomenon has been studied experimentally and theoretically for a state-of-art metal-oxide memristive device based on yttria-stabilized zirconium dioxide and tantalum pentoxide, which exhibits bipolar filamentary resistive switching of anionic type. The effect of white Gaussian noise superimposed on the sub-threshold sinusoidal driving signal is analyzed through the time series statistics of the resistive switching parameters, the spectral response to a periodic perturbation and the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the nonlinear system. The stabilized resistive switching and the increased memristance response are revealed in the observed regularities at an optimal noise intensity corresponding to the stochastic resonance phenomenon and interpreted using a stochastic memristor model taking into account an external noise source added to the control voltage. The obtained results clearly show that noise and fluctuations can play a constructive role in nonlinear memristive systems far from equilibrium.},

  abstract = {As light can mediate interactions between atoms in a photonic environment, engineering it for endowing the photon-mediated Hamiltonian with desired features, like robustness against disorder, is crucial in quantum research. We provide general theorems on the topology of photon-mediated interactions in terms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological invariants, unveiling the phenomena of topological preservation and reversal, and revealing a system-bath topological correspondence. Depending on the Hermiticity of the environment and the parity of the spatial dimension, the atomic and photonic topological invariants turn out to be equal or opposite. Consequently, the emergence of atomic and photonic topological boundary modes with opposite group velocities in two-dimensional Hermitian topological systems is established. Owing to its general applicability, our results can guide the design of topological systems.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermitian physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique topological features such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as probes for bulk Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity reaching Heisenberg scaling. Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral topological phase transition, where the entire spectrum undergoes a delocalization transition. We provide an explanation for this enhanced sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely non-Hermitian energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a direct connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the non-Hermitian realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic non-Hermitian topological models in various dimensions and potential experimental implementations.},

  abstract = {The main aim of this special issue is to report the recent advances and new trends in memristors and nonequilibrium stochastic multistable systems, both theoretically and experimentally, within an interdisciplinary context. In particular, memristors are multistable systems whose switching dynamics is a stochastic process, which can be controlled by internal and external noise sources, unveiling the constructive role of random fluctuations. Furthermore, the use of memristors as memory elements in neuromorphic systems with noise-assisted persistence of memory states, chaotic dynamics, metastable chaos and chaos synchronization, new stochastic nonlinear models, noise-induced phenomena such as stochastic resonance, noise enhanced stability and phase transitions phenomena in memristors will be illustrated in the contributions of this special issue.}

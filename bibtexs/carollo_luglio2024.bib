title = {Quantum-enhanced sensing from non-{Hermitian} topology},
abstract = {Non-Hermitian physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique topological features such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as probes for bulk Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity reaching Heisenberg scaling. Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral topological phase transition, where the entire spectrum undergoes a delocalization transition. We provide an explanation for this enhanced sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely non-Hermitian energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a direct connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the non-Hermitian realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic non-Hermitian topological models in various dimensions and potential experimental implementations.},

@article{di_fresco_metrology_2023,
title = {Metrology and multipartite entanglement in measurement-induced phase transition},
abstract = {Measurement-induced phase transition arises from the competition between a deterministic quantum evolution and a repeated measurement process. We explore the measurement-induced phase transition through the Quantum Fisher Information in two different metrological scenarios. We demonstrate through the scaling behavior of the quantum Fisher information the transition of the multi-partite entanglement across the phases. In analogy with standard quantum phase transition, we reveal signature of a measurement-induced phase transition in the non-analytic behaviour of the quantum Fisher information as the measurement strength approaches the critical value. Our results offer novel insights into the features of a quantum systems undergoing measurement-induced phase transition and indicate potential avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum physics.},

@article{paviglianiti_breakdown_2024,
title = {Breakdown of {Measurement}-{Induced} {Phase} {Transitions} {Under} {Information} {Loss}},
abstract = {The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.},

title = {Nonlinearity-enhanced quantum sensing in {Stark} probes},
abstract = {Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been harnessed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark models, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating the strength of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields. The problem naturally lies in the context of multi-parameter estimation. We determine the phase diagram of the system in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the extended phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. We also characterize the properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, through a comprehesive finite-size scaling analysis. Interestingly, our results show that the estimation of both the linear and the nonlinear fields can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling. In fact, the scaling exponent of the sensing precision is directly proportional to the nonlinearity exponent which shows that nonlinearity enhances the estimation precision. Finally, we show that even after considering the cost of the preparation time the sensing precision still reveals super-Heisenberg scaling.},

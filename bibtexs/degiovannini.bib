abstract = {{In recent years, strong-field physics in condensed matter was pioneered as a potential approach for controlling material properties through laser dressing, as well as for ultrafast spectroscopy via nonlinear light-matter interactions (e.g., harmonic generation). A potential controversy arising from these advancements is that it is sometimes vague which band picture should be used to interpret strong-field experiments: The field-free bands, the adiabatic (instantaneous) field-dressed bands, Floquet bands, or some other intermediate picture. Here, we try to resolve this issue by performing theoretical experiments of time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) for a strong-field laser-pumped solid, which should give access to the actual observable bands of the irradiated material. To our surprise, we find that the adiabatic band picture survives quite well up to high field intensities (∼1012W/cm2) and in a wide frequency range (driving wavelengths of 4000 to 800 nm, with Keldysh parameters ranging up to ∼7). We conclude that, to first order, the adiabatic instantaneous bands should be the standard blueprint for interpreting ultrafast electron dynamics in solids when the field is highly off resonant with characteristic energy scales of the material. We then discuss weaker effects of modifications of the bands beyond this picture that are nonadiabatic, showing that by using bichromatic fields the deviations from the standard picture can be probed with enhanced sensitivity. In this paper, we outline a clear band picture for the physics of strong-field interactions in solids, which should be useful for designing and analyzing strong-field experimental observables and to formulate simpler semi-empirical models.}},

However, exciton mobility remains inaccessible to traditional optical experiments that only create and detect excitons with negligible momentum. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we detect dispersing excitons in the quasi-one-dimensional metallic trichalcogenide, TaSe3. The low density of conduction electrons and the low dimensionality in TaSe3 combined with a polaronic renormalization of the conduction band and the poorly screened interaction between these polarons and photo-induced valence holes leads to various excitonic bound states that we interpret as intrachain and interchain excitons, and possibly trions. The thresholds for the formation of a photo-hole together with an exciton appear as side valence bands with dispersions nearly parallel to the main valence band, but shifted to lower excitation energies. The energy separation between side and main valence bands can be controlled by surface doping, enabling the tuning of certain exciton properties. Mobile excitons in metals have been elusive, as screening usually suppresses their formation. Here, the authors demonstrate such mobile bound states in quasi-one-dimensional metallic TaSe3, taking advantage of its low dimensionality and carrier density.}},

In the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range, multi-electronic phenomena and bands of correlated states with inner-valence holes must be accounted for in addition to a plethora of vibrational modes and available dissociation channels. To be able to track changes in charge density and bond length during ultrafast reactions is an important endeavour towards more general abilities to simulate and control photochemical processes, possibly inspired by those that have evolved biologically. By using attosecond XUV pulses extending up to 35 eV and few-femtosecond near-infrared pulses, we have previously time-resolved correlated electronic dynamics and charge migration occurring in the biologically relevant molecule adenine after XUV-induced sudden ionization. Here, by using additional experimental data, we comprehensively report on both electronic and vibrational dynamics of this nucleobase in an energy range little explored to date with high temporal resolution. The time-dependent yields of parent and fragment ions in mass spectra are analysed to extract exponential time constants and oscillation periods. Together with time-dependent density functional theory and ab-initio Green’s function methods, we identify different vibrational and electronic processes. Beyond providing further insights into the XUV-induced dynamics of an important nucleobase, our work demonstrates that yields of specific dissociation outcomes can be influenced by sufficiently well-timed ultrashort pulses, therefore providing a new route for the control of the multi-electronic and dissociative dynamics of a DNA building block.}},

We find, through state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, that the structure of the emission spectrum is attenuated by the presence of coherent phonons and no longer comprises discrete harmonic orders, but rather a continuous emission in the plateau region. The HHG yield strongly oscillates as a function of the pump-probe delay, corresponding to ultrafast changes in the lattice such as specific bond compression or stretching dynamics. We further show that in the regime where the excited phonon period and the pulse duration are of the same order of magnitude, the HHG process becomes sensitive to the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the driving field, even though the pulse duration is so long that no such sensitivity is observed in the absence of coherent phonons. The degree of CEP sensitivity versus pump-probe delay is shown to be a highly selective measure for instantaneous structural changes in the lattice, providing an approach for ultrafast multidimensional HHG spectroscopy. Remarkably, the obtained temporal resolution for phonon dynamics is ∼1 femtosecond, which is much shorter than the probe pulse duration because of the inherent subcycle contrast mechanism. Our work paves the way toward routes of probing phonons and ultrafast material structural changes with subcycle temporal resolution and provides a mechanism for controlling the HHG spectrum.}},

We achieve this goal with a combination of quantum optimal control theory and Floquet engineering. The power and versatility of this framework is demonstrated here by utilizing the independent-electron tight-binding description of the π electronic system of graphene. We show several prototype examples focusing on the region around the K (Dirac) point of the Brillouin zone: creation of a gap with opposing flat valence and conduction bands, creation of a gap with opposing concave symmetric valence and conduction bands (which would correspond to a material with an effective negative electron-hole mass), and closure of the gap when departing from a modified graphene model with a nonzero field-free gap. We employ time-periodic drives with several frequency components and polarizations, in contrast to the usual monochromatic fields, and use control theory to find the amplitudes of each component that optimize the shape of the bands as desired. In addition, we use quantum control methods to find realistic switch-on pulses that bring the material into the predefined stationary Floquet band structure, i.e., into a state in which the desired Floquet modes of the target bands are fully occupied, so that they should remain stroboscopically stationary, with long lifetimes, when the weak periodic drives are started. Finally, we note that although we have focused on solid state materials, the technique that we propose could be equally used for the Floquet engineering of ultracold atoms in optical lattices and for other nonequilibrium dynamical and correlated systems.}},

Here we ionized Ne atoms with few-femtosecond pulses of selected time duration and show that a Floquet state can be observed already with a driving field that lasts for only 10 cycles. For shorter pulses, down to 2 cycles, the finite lifetime of the driven state can still be explained using an analytical model based on Floquet theory. By demonstrating that the amplitude and number of Floquet-like sidebands in the photoelectron spectrum can be controlled not only with the driving laser pulse intensity and frequency, but also by its duration, our results add a new lever to the toolbox of Floquet engineering. Floquet engineering aims at inducing new properties in materials with light. Here the authors have used pulses of variable durations, to investigate its applicability in the femtosecond domain.

Its simplest interpretation is obtained in the plane-wave approximation, according to which photoelectrons propagate freely to the detector. The photoelectron momentum distribution is then essentially given by the Fourier transform of the real-space orbital. While the plane-wave approximation is remarkably successful in describing the momentum distributions of aromatic compounds, it generally fails to capture kinetic-energy-dependent final-state interference and dichroism effects. Focusing our present study on quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene as the archetypical two-dimensional (2D) material, we observe an exemplary Ekin-dependent modulation of, and a redistribution of spectral weight within, its characteristic horseshoe signature around the K¯ and K¯′ points: both effects indeed cannot be rationalized by the plane-wave final state. Our data are, however, in remarkable agreement with ab initio time-dependent density functional simulations of a freestanding graphene layer and can be explained by a simple extension of the plane-wave final state, permitting the two dipole-allowed partial waves emitted from the C 2pz orbitals to scatter in the potential of their immediate surroundings. Exploiting the absolute photon flux calibration of the Metrology Light Source, this scattered-wave approximation allows us to extract Ekin-dependent amplitudes and phases of both partial waves directly from photoemission data. The scattered-wave approximation thus represents a powerful yet intuitive refinement of the plane-wave final state in photoemission of 2D materials and beyond.}},

For potentials which are constant outside a bounded domain, FCD yields a high-order accurate numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation directly in free space, without the need for artificial boundary conditions. Of the many existing artificial boundary condition schemes, FCD is most similar to an exact nonlocal transparent boundary condition, but it works directly on Cartesian grids in any dimension, and runs on top of the fast Fourier transform rather than fast algorithms for the application of nonlocal history integral operators. We adapt FCD to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and describe a simple algorithm to smoothly and automatically truncate long-range Coulomb-like potentials to a time-dependent constant outside of a bounded domain of interest, so that FCD can be used. This approach eliminates errors originating from the use of artificial boundary conditions, leaving only the error of the potential truncation, which is controlled and can be systematically reduced. The method enables accurate simulations of ultrastrong nonlinear electronic processes in molecular complexes in which the interference between bound and continuum states is of paramount importance. We demonstrate results for many-electron TDDFT calculations of absorption and strong field photoelectron spectra for one and two-dimensional models, and observe a significant reduction in the size of the computational domain required to achieve high quality results, as compared with the popular method of complex absorbing potentials.}},

At the forefront of these advancements, several works proposed using HHG as an all-optical probe for topology of quantum matter by identifying its signatures in the emission spectra. However, it remains unclear if such spectral signatures are indeed a robust and general approach for probing topology. To address this point, we perform a fully ab initio study of HHG from prototypical two-dimensional topological insulators in the Kane-Mele quantum spin-Hall and anomalous-Hall phases. We analyze the spectra and previously proposed topological signatures by comparing HHG from the topological and trivial phases and across the phase transition. We demonstrate and provide detailed microscopic explanations of why, in these systems, none of the observables proposed thus far uniquely and universally probes material topology. Specifically, we find that the (i) HHG helicity, (ii) anomalous HHG ellipticity, (iii) HHG elliptical dichroism, and (iv) temporal delays in HHG emission are all unreliable signatures of topological phases. Our results suggest that extreme care must be taken when interpreting HHG spectra for topological signatures and that contributions from the crystal symmetries and chemical nature might be dominant over those from topology. They hint that a truly universal topological signature in nonlinear optics is unlikely and raise important questions regarding possible utilization and detection of topology in out-of-equilibrium systems.}},

Through state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, we predict that a nonmagnetic material can transiently transform into a magnetic one via dynamical extremely nonlinear spin-flipping processes, which occur on attosecond timescales and are mediated by cascaded multi-photon and spin–orbit interactions. These are nonperturbative nonresonant analogs to the inverse Faraday effect, allowing the magnetization to evolve in very high harmonics of the laser frequency (e.g. here up to the 42nd, oscillating at \textbackslashtextasciitilde100 attoseconds), and providing control over the speed of magnetization by tuning the laser power and wavelength. Remarkably, we show that even for linearly polarized driving, where one does not intuitively expect the onset of an induced magnetization, the magnetization transiently oscillates as the system interacts with light. This response is enabled by transverse light-driven currents in the solid, and typically occurs on timescales of \textbackslashtextasciitilde500 attoseconds (with the slower femtosecond response suppressed). An experimental setup capable of measuring these dynamics through pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy is simulated.

abstract = {{To define the topology of driven systems, recent works have proposed synthetic dimensions as a way to uncover the underlying parameter space of topological invariants. Using time as a synthetic dimension, together with a momentum dimension, gives access to a synthetic two-dimensional (2D) Chern number. It is, however, still unclear how the synthetic 2D Chern number is related to the Chern number that is defined from a parametric variable that evolves with time. Here we show that in periodically driven systems in the adiabatic limit, the synthetic 2D Chern number is a multiple of the Chern number defined from the parametric variable. The synthetic 2D Chern number can thus be engineered via how the parametric variable evolves in its own space. We justify our claims by investigating Thouless pumping in two one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding models, a three-site chain model, and a two-1D-sliding-chains model. The present findings could be extended to higher dimensions and other periodically driven configurations.}},

Increasing the strength of the laser field, besides the expected topological phase transition (PT), the magnetically doped topological insulator thin film also undergoes a magnetic PT from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism, whose critical behavior strongly depends on the quantum quenching. In sharp contrast to the equilibrium case, the non-equilibrium Curie temperatures vary for different time scale and experimental setup, not all relying on change of topology. Our discoveries deepen the understanding of the relationship between topology and magnetism in the non-equilibrium regime and extend optoelectronic device applications to topological materials.}},

The search for the shape of the periodic perturbation that best modifies the properties of a system in order to achieve some predefined metastable target behavior can be formulated as an optimal control problem. We discuss several ways to formulate and solve this problem. We present, as examples, some applications in the context of material science, although the methods discussed here are valid for any quantum system (from molecules and nanostructures to extended periodic and non periodic quantum materials). In particular, we show how one can achieve the manipulation of the Floquet pseudo-bandstructure of a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer (MoS 2 ).}},

abstract = {{Floquet engineering has recently emerged as a technique for controlling material properties with light. Floquet phases can be probed with time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES), providing direct access to the laser-dressed electronic bands. Applications of Tr-ARPES to date focused on observing the Floquet-Bloch bands themselves, and their build-up and dephasing on sub-laser-cycle timescales. However, momentum and energy resolved sub-laser-cycle dynamics between Floquet bands have not been analyzed. Given that Floquet theory strictly applies in time-periodic conditions, the notion of resolving sub-laser-cycle dynamics between Floquet states seems contradictory - it requires probe pulse durations below a laser cycle that inherently cannot discern the time-periodic nature of the light-matter system. Here we propose to employ attosecond pulse train probes with the same temporal periodicity as the Floquet-dressing pump pulse, allowing both attosecond sub-laser-cycle resolution and a proper projection of Tr-ARPES spectra on the Floquet-Bloch bands. We formulate and employ this approach in ab-initio calculations in light-driven graphene. Our calculations predict significant sub-laser-cycle dynamics occurring within the Floquet phase with the majority of electrons moving within and in-between Floquet bands, and a small portion residing and moving outside of them in what we denote as 'non-Floquet' bands. We establish that non-Floquet bands arise from the pump laser envelope that induces non-adiabatic electronic excitations during the pulse turn-on and turn-off. By performing calculations in systems with poly-chromatic pumps we also show that Floquet states are not formed on a sub-laser-cycle level. This work indicates that the Floquet-Bloch states are generally not a complete basis set for sub-laser-cycle dynamics in steady-state phases of matter.}},

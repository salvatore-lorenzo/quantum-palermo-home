      abstract ={We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according to their Markovianity and spatial correlations. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various noises are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. This approach reaches around 90% accuracy with a minimal experimental overhead},

  abstract = {It has recently been claimed that a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index of 4d N=4 SYM accounts for the entropy function, whose Legendre transform corresponds to the entropy of the holographic dual AdS5 rotating black hole. Here we study this Cardy-like limit for N=1 toric quiver gauge theories, observing that the corresponding entropy function can be interpreted in terms of the toric data. Furthermore, for some families of models, we compute the Legendre transform of the entropy function, comparing with similar results recently discussed in the literature.},

  abstract = {AdS7 supersymmetric solutions in type IIA have been classified, and they are infinitely many. Moreover, every such solution has a non-supersymmetric sister. In this pa- per, we study the perturbative and non-perturbative stability of these non-supersymmetric solutions, focusing on cases without orientifolds. Perturbatively, we first look at the KK spectrum of spin-2 excitations. This does not exhibit instabilities, but it does show that there is no separation of scales for either the BPS and the non-BPS case, thus proving for supersymmetric AdS7 a well-known recent conjecture. We then use 7d gauged supergravity and a brane polarization computation to access part of the spectrum of KK scalars. The result signals an instability for all non-supersymmetric solutions except those that have a single D8 on each side. We finally look at non-perturbative instabilities, and find that NS5 bubbles make these remaining solutions decay.},

The non-supersymmetric backgrounds carry identical 5-brane charges and are connected to the supersymmetric ones by RG flows. We study the stability of the non-supersymmetric solutions, identifying perturbative and non-perturbative decay channels for all the backgrounds explicitly available. We also identify likely decay mechanisms for solutions that have not been constructed explicitly but may be expected to exist based on brane web considerations. Finally, we exclude scale separation by constructing universal spin 2 modes with masses comparable to the mass-scale of the cosmological constant.},

This allows us to obtain a new constraint on the validity of this stabilization mechanism. This effect does not appear hard to satisfy in de Sitter construction proposals that use long warped throats, but may be problematic in proposals where the warping is small.},

Firstly, a D=4, SO(4)-invariant restricted duality hierarchy is constructed and used to uplift the entire, dynamical SO(4)-invariant sector to massive type IIA. The resulting consistent uplift formulae are used to obtain a new local expression for the N=3 AdS4 solution in massive IIA and analyse its geometry. Locally, the internal S6 geometry corresponds to a warped fibration of S2 and a hemisphere of S4. This can be regarded as a warped generalisation of the usual twistor fibration geometry. Finally, the triplet of Killing spinors corresponding to the N=3 solution are constructed and shown to obey the massive type IIA Killing spinor equations.},

Nilpotent elements have a natural partial ordering, which has been conjectured to coincide with the hierarchy of renormalization-group flows among the SCFTs. In this paper we test this conjecture for G = SU(k), where AdS7 duals exist in IIA. We work with a seven-dimensional gauged supergravity, consisting of the gravity multiplet and two SU(k) non-Abelian vector multiplets. We show that this theory has many supersymmetric AdS7 vacua, determined by two nilpotent elements, which are naturally interpreted as IIA AdS7 solutions. The BPS equations for domain walls connecting two such vacua can be solved analytically, up to a Nahm equation with certain boundary conditions. The latter admit a solution connecting two vacua if and only if the corresponding nilpotent elements are related by the natural partial ordering, in agreement with the field theory conjecture.},

We propose an extension of both the free theory and of its cubic deformation to a more general class of partially reducible systems, that one can obtain from the original theory upon imposing trace constraints of various orders. The key to our results is a version of the Noether procedure allowing to systematically account for the deformations of the transversality conditions to be imposed on the gauge parameters at the free level.},

Previously it has been proposed that the corresponding quiver theory has a link involving the T(U(N)) theory. In this paper, we generalise the preceding result by studying quivers that contain a T(G) link, where G is self-dual under S-duality. In particular, the cases of G = SO(2N), USp{$\prime$}(2N) and G2 are examined in detail. We propose the theories that arise from an appropriate insertion of an S-fold into a brane system, in the presence of an orientifold threeplane or an orientifold fiveplane. By analysing the moduli spaces, we test such a proposal against its S-dual configuration using mirror symmetry. The case of G2 corresponds to a novel class of quivers, whose brane construction is not available. We present several mirror pairs, containing G2 gauge groups, that have not been discussed before in the literature.},

An important feature of such a quiver is that it contains a link, which is the T (U(N)) theory, between two U(N) groups, along with bifundamental and fundamental hypermultiplets. We systematically study the moduli spaces of those quiver theories, including the cases in which the non-zero Chern-Simons levels are turned on.

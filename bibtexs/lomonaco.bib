    abstract = {Anti-D3 branes at the bottom of warped throats, commonly used to uplift the cosmological constant in String-Theory de Sitter proposals, source a plethora of supersymmetry-breaking fluxes, that can interact nontrivially with other ingredients of the flux compactification. In this paper we perform a complex-structure decomposition of these fluxes, and compute the effect of the (0,3) flux component on the stabilization of K{\"a}hler moduli via D7-branes gaugino condensation. This allows us to obtain a new constraint on the validity of this stabilization mechanism. This effect does not appear hard to satisfy in de Sitter construction proposals that use long warped throats, but may be problematic in proposals where the warping is small.}

We describe these terms both from a ten-dimensional and from a four-dimensional perspective and show that, upon including K{\"a}hler-moduli stabilization, the resulting potential admits de Sitter minima. Our proposed de Sitter construction does not require additional supersymmetry-breaking (0,3) fluxes, and hence is more minimalist than the KKLT proposal.}

In this pa- per, we study the perturbative and non-perturbative stability of these non-supersymmetric solutions, focusing on cases without orientifolds. Perturbatively, we first look at the KK spectrum of spin-2 excitations. This does not exhibit instabilities, but it does show that there is no separation of scales for either the BPS and the non-BPS case, thus proving for supersymmetric AdS7 a well-known recent conjecture. We then use 7d gauged supergravity and a brane polarization computation to access part of the spectrum of KK scalars. The result signals an instability for all non-supersymmetric solutions except those that have a single D8 on each side. We finally look at non-perturbative instabilities, and find that NS5 bubbles make these remaining solutions decay.}

In this paper, we generalise the preceding result by studying quivers that contain a T(G) link, where G is self-dual under S-duality. In particular, the cases of G = SO(2N), USp′(2N) and G2 are examined in detail. We propose the theories that arise from an appropriate insertion of an S-fold into a brane system, in the presence of an orientifold threeplane or an orientifold fiveplane. By analysing the moduli spaces, we test such a proposal against its S-dual configuration using mirror symmetry. The case of G2 corresponds to a novel class of quivers, whose brane construction is not available. We present several mirror pairs, containing G2 gauge groups, that have not been discussed before in the literature.}

An important feature of such a quiver is that it contains a link, which is the T (U(N)) theory, between two U(N) groups, along with bifundamental and fundamental hypermultiplets. We systematically study the moduli spaces of those quiver theories, including the cases in which the non-zero Chern-Simons levels are turned on.

We work with a seven-dimensional gauged supergravity, consisting of the gravity multiplet and two SU(k) non-Abelian vector multiplets. We show that this theory has many supersymmetric AdS7 vacua, determined by two nilpotent elements, which are naturally interpreted as IIA AdS7 solutions. The BPS equations for domain walls connecting two such vacua can be solved analytically, up to a Nahm equation with certain boundary conditions. The latter admit a solution connecting two vacua if and only if the corresponding nilpotent elements are related by the natural partial ordering, in agreement with the field theory conjecture.}

The resulting consistent uplift formulae are used to obtain a new local expression for the $\mathcal{N}=3$ AdS4 solution in massive IIA and analyse its geometry. Locally, the internal S6 geometry corresponds to a warped fibration of S2 and a hemisphere of S4. This can be regarded as a warped generalisation of the usual twistor fibration geometry.

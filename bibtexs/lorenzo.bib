  abstract = {The search for strategies to harness the temperature of quantum systems is one of the main goals in quantum thermodynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a system made of a pair of quantum harmonic oscillators, represented by single-mode cavity fields, interacting with a thermally excited beam of phaseonium atoms, which act as ancillas. The two cavities are arranged in a cascade configuration, so that the second cavity interacts with phaseonium atoms only after their interaction with the first one. We provide exact closed dynamics of the first cavity for arbitrarily long interaction times. We highlight the role played by the characteristic coherence phase of phaseonium atoms in determining the steady states of the cavity fields as well as that of the ancillas. Also, we show how the second cavity follows a non-Markovian evolution due to interactions with the "used" ancillary atoms, that enables information exchange with the first cavity. Adjusting the parameters of the phaseonium atoms, we can determine the final stable temperature reached by the cavities. In this way, the cavities can be heated up as well as cooled down. These results provide useful insights towards the use of different types of ancillas for thermodynamic cycles in cavity QED scenarios.},

Whereas, the transfer of a single qubit state has been extensively investigated, the transfer of a many-body system configuration has insofar remained elusive. We address the problem of transferring the state of n interacting qubits. Both the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension, and the presence of interactions significantly scale-up the complexity of achieving high-fidelity transfer. By employing tools from random matrix theory and using the formalism of quantum dynamical maps, we derive a general expression for the average and the variance of the fidelity of an arbitrary quantum state transfer protocol for n interacting qubits. Finally, by adopting a weak-coupling scheme in a spin chain, we obtain the explicit conditions for high-fidelity transfer of three and four interacting qubits.},

  abstract = {The distribution of entangled states is a key task of utmost importance for many quantum information processing protocols. A commonly adopted setup for distributing quantum states envisages the creation of the state in one location, which is then sent to (possibly different) distant receivers through some quantum channels. While it is undoubted and, perhaps, intuitively expected that the distribution of entangled quantum states is less efficient than that of product states, a thorough quantification of this inefficiency (namely, of the difference between the quantum-state transfer fidelity for entangled and factorized states) has not been performed. To this end, in this work, we consider \$n\$-independent amplitude-damping channels, acting in parallel, i.e., each, locally, on one part of an \$n\$-qubit state. We derive exact analytical results for the fidelity decrease, with respect to the case of product states, in the presence of entanglement in the initial state, for up to four qubits. Interestingly, we find that genuine multipartite entanglement has a more detrimental effect on the fidelity than two-qubit entanglement. Our results hint at the fact that, for larger \$n\$-qubit states, the difference in the average fidelity between product and entangled states increases with increasing single-qubit fidelity, thus making the latter a less trustworthy figure of merit.},

Faithful Gibbs state preparation would pave the way to investigate protocols such as thermalization and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, as well as providing useful resources for quantum algorithms, where sampling from Gibbs states constitutes a key subroutine. We propose a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to prepare Gibbs states of a quantum many-body system. The novelty of our VQA consists in implementing a parameterized quantum circuit acting on two distinct, yet connected, quantum registers. The VQA evaluates the Helmholtz free energy, where the von Neumann entropy is obtained via post-processing of computational basis measurements on one register, while the Gibbs state is prepared on the other register, via a unitary rotation in the energy basis. Finally, we benchmark our VQA by preparing Gibbs states of the transverse field Ising model and achieve remarkably high fidelities across a broad range of temperatures in statevector simulations. We also assess the performance of the VQA on IBM quantum computers, showcasing its feasibility on current NISQ devices.},

By showing that the formalism of measurement frames offers a natural framework for shadow tomography---in which ``classical shadows'' correspond to unbiased estimators derived from a suitable dual frame associated with the given measurement---we highlight the intrinsic connection between standard state tomography and shadow tomography. Such a perspective allows us to examine the interplay between measurements, reconstructed observables, and the estimators used to process measurement outcomes, while paving the way to assessing the influence of the input state and the dimension of the underlying space on estimation errors. Our approach generalizes the method described by Huang et al. [H.-Y. Huang et al., Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], whose results are recovered in the special case of covariant measurement frames. As an application, we demonstrate that a sought-after target of shadow tomography can be achieved for the entire class of tight rank-1 measurement frames---namely, that it is possible to accurately estimate a finite set of generic rank-1 bounded observables while avoiding the growth of the number of the required samples with the state dimension.},

We present a framework to model QRCs and QELMs, showing that they can be concisely described via single effective measurements, and provide an explicit characterisation of the information exactly retrievable with such protocols. We furthermore find a close analogy between the training process of QELMs and that of reconstructing the effective measurement characterising the given device. Our analysis paves the way to a more thorough understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both QELMs and QRCs, and has the potential to become a powerful measurement paradigm for quantum state estimation that is more resilient to noise and imperfections.},

We argue that this approach comes with a number of issues, in large part due to its reliance on quantum mutual informations, which do not faithfully quantify correlations directly retrievable via measurements, and in part due to the specific methodology used to compute tripartite informations of the studied dynamics. We show that these issues can be overcome by using accessible mutual informations, defining corresponding ``accessible tripartite informations'', and provide explicit examples of dynamics whose scrambling properties are not properly quantified by the standard tripartite information. Our results lay the groundwork for a more profound understanding of what QIS represents, and reveal a number of promising, as of yet unexplored, venues for futher research.},

While accurately quantifying QIS is crucial to understanding many such phenomena, common approaches based on the tripartite information have limitations due to the accessibility issues of quantum mutual information, and do not always properly take into consideration the dependence on the encoding input basis. To address these issues, we propose a novel and computationally efficient QIS quantifier, based on a formulation of QIS in terms of quantum state discrimination. We show that the optimal guessing probability, which reflects the degree of QIS induced by an isometric quantum evolution, is directly connected to the accessible min-information, a generalized channel capacity based on conditional min-entropy, which can be cast as a convex program and thus computed efficiently. By applying our proposal to a range of examples with increasing complexity, we illustrate its ability to capture the multifaceted nature of QIS in all its intricacy.},

Focusing on the regime where the cavity modes can be adiabatically eliminated, we derive an effective coupling between the two mechanical modes and explore the classical and quantum correlations established between the modes in both the transient and the stationary regime, highlighting their asymmmetrical nature due to the unidirectional coupling. Noteworthy, we find that a constant amount of steady correlations can exist at long times. Furthermore we show that this unidirectional coupling establishes a temperature gradient between the mirrors, depending on the frequencies' detuning.

At the same time, non-Hermitian (NH) physics is currently thriving, spurred by the exciting possibility to access new physics in systems ruled by non-trivial NH Hamiltonians---in particular, photonic lattices---which can challenge longstanding tenets such as the Bloch theory of bands. Here, we combine these two fields and study the exotic interaction between emitters mediated by the photonic modes of a lossy photonic lattice described by a NH Hamiltonian. We show in a paradigmatic case study that structured losses in the field can seed exotic emission properties. Photons can mediate dissipative, fully non-reciprocal interactions between emitters with range critically dependent on the loss rate. When this loss rate corresponds to a bare-lattice exceptional point, the effective couplings are exactly nearest neighbor, implementing a dissipative, fully non-reciprocal Hatano--Nelson model. Counterintuitively, this can occur irrespective of the lattice boundary conditions. Thus photons can mediate an effective emitter's Hamiltonian which is translationally invariant despite the fact that the field is not. We interpret these effects in terms of metastable atom--photon dressed states, which can be exactly localized on only two lattice cells or extended across the entire lattice. These findings introduce a paradigm of light-mediated interactions with unprecedented features such as non-reciprocity, non-trivial dependence on field boundary conditions, and range tunability via a loss rate.},

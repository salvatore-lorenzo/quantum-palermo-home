      abstract ={The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is a phenomenon observed in many-body systems where initial systems configurations farther from equilibrium can be observed to equilibrate faster than configurations that are closer to it. By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in U(1) symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.},

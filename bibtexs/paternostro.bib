  abstract = {Crossing a quantum critical point in finite time challenges the adiabatic condition due to the closing of the energy gap, which ultimately results in the formation of excitations. Such non-adiabatic excitations are typically deemed detrimental in many scenarios, and consequently several strategies have been put forward to circumvent their formation. Here, however, we show how these non-adiabatic excitations -- originated from the failure to meet the adiabatic condition due to the presence of a quantum critical point -- can be controlled and thus harnessed to perform certain tasks advantageously. We focus on closed cycles reaching the quantum critical point of fully-connected models analyzing two examples. First, a quantum battery that is loaded by approaching a quantum critical point, whose stored and extractable work increases exponentially via repeating cycles. Second, a scheme for the fast preparation of spin squeezed states containing multipartite entanglement that offer a metrological advantage. The corresponding figure of merit in both cases crucially depends on universal critical exponents and the scaling of the protocol driving the system in the vicinity of the transition. Our results highlight the rich interplay between quantum thermodynamics and metrology with critical nonequilibrium dynamics.},

Prospective applications include metrology, geodesy and measurement of terrestrial mass change due to, e.g., climate change, and fundamental science experiments such as tests of the equivalence principle, searches for dark matter, measurements of gravitational waves and tests of quantum mechanics. We review the current status of cold atom technologies and outline the requirements for their space qualification, including the development paths and the corresponding technical milestones, and identifying possible pathfinder missions to pave the way for missions to exploit the full potential of cold atoms in space. Finally, we present a first draft of a possible road-map for achieving these goals, that we propose for discussion by the interested cold atom, Earth Observation, fundamental physics and other prospective scientific user communities, together with the European Space Agency (ESA) and national space and research funding agencies.},

As a paradigmatic situation currently addressed in frontier experiments aimed at investigating possible collapse theories, we consider a one-dimensional mechanical oscillator in a thermal state. We perform our analysis in the phase space of the oscillator, where the entropy production rate, a non-equilibrium quantity used to characterize irreversibility, can be conveniently analyzed. We show that the CSL model violates Clausius law, as it exhibits a negative entropy production rate, while the dCSL model reaches equilibrium consistently only under certain dynamical conditions, thus allowing us to identify the values---in the parameter space---where the latter mechanism can be faithfully used to describe a thermodynamically consistent phenomenon.},

In particular, we focus on superconducting platforms and consider a network of qubits---encoded in the states of artificial atoms with no direct coupling---interacting via a common single-mode driven microwave resonator. The qubit-resonator couplings are assumed to be in the resonant regime and tunable in time. A genetic algorithm is used in order to find the functional time-dependence of the couplings that optimise the fidelity between the evolved state and a variety of targets, including three-qubit GHZ and Dicke states and four-qubit graph states. We observe high quantum fidelities (above 0.96 in the worst case setting of a system of effective dimension 96), fast preparation times, and resilience to noise, despite the algorithm being trained in the ideal noise-free setting. These results show that the genetic algorithms represent an effective approach to control quantum systems of large dimensions.},

Experiments on the ground, in micro-gravity, and in space will drive the proposed research campaign during the current decade to enable the implementation of MAQRO within the subsequent decade.},

  abstract = {The detection of entanglement provides a definitive proof of quantumness. Its ascertainment might be challenging for hot or macroscopic objects, where entanglement is typically weak, but nevertheless present. Here we propose a platform for measuring entanglement by connecting the objects of interest to an uncontrolled quantum network, whose emission (readout) is trained to learn and sense the entanglement of the former. First, we demonstrate the platform and its features with generic quantum systems. As the network effectively learns to recognise quantum states, it is possible to sense the amount of entanglement after training with only non-entangled states. Furthermore, by taking into account measurement errors, we demonstrate entanglement sensing with precision that scales beyond the standard quantum limit and outperforms measurements performed directly on the objects. Finally, we utilise our platform for sensing gravity-induced entanglement between two masses and predict an improvement of two orders of magnitude in the precision of entanglement estimation compared to existing techniques.},

It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to non-equilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress in such endeavour. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production on them. This paper aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment and manipulation of entropy production. We present both formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments.},

We develop a strategy for entanglement distribution via separable carriers that can be applied to any number of network nodes to achieve various entanglement distribution patterns. We show that our protocol results in multipartite entanglement, while the carrier mediating the process is always in a separable state with respect to the network.

In some scenarios, such consumption is reversed due to an environment-induced back-action that causes the return of the information to the system. This phenomenon can be related to existence of non-Markovian mechanisms in the environment and such transformation of resources can be useful for quantum information applications. Thus, understanding the details of the system-environment information dynamics, i.e., the transference of quantum resources is of key importance to design noise-resilient quantum technologies. In this work, we show how a quantum resource, named quantum coherence, propagates from the main system to an environment, using as model a single qubit coupled to two linear chains of qubits, and also the information dynamics among the environment qubits. In this way, we characterize the propagation of information leaving the main qubit and going through the environment, as well as its return from the environment to the main system. Finally, we connect the conditions for the emergence of this dynamics to the existence of quantum Darwinism.},

To this end, we shall consider a two-qubit state, sharing initial quantum correlations in the form of Quantum Discord, and different dephasing-like interactions between them and an observing environment. We will focus on the amount of information regarding the subsystem not involved in the interaction that is proliferated to the environment. We shall refer to this as mediated redundancy.

To this end, we consider a system in contact with two baths: one---termed the accessible environment ---which, on its own, induces a pure dephasing mechanism on the state of the system and satisfies the conditions for classical objectivity to be established. The second environment, which we dub as inaccessible , affects the system in two physically relevant ways. Firstly, we consider an interaction that commutes with the Hamiltonian describing the interaction between system and accessible bath. It thus also gives rise to dephasing of the system, albeit on different time scales. Secondly, we consider a thermalising interaction, which does not commute with the system-accessible environment Hamiltonian. While the former still allows the system to redundantly encode its state into the accessible environment, the latter degrades the correlations, eventually destroying them in the long-time limit, and thus leads to a loss of the conditions necessary for classical objectivity to be established. This sheds light on the role that commutativity between the various system-bath interaction terms plays when establishing the conditions for classical objectivity to be supported.},

First, we show that the activation of quantum maps through the quantum switch model always entails a non-negative gain in ergotropy compared to their consecutive application. We also establish a condition that the maps should fulfill in order to achieve a non-zero ergotropic gain. We then perform a thorough analysis of maps applied to a two-level system and provide general conditions for achieving a positive gain on the incoherent part of ergotropy. Our results are illustrated with several examples and applied to qubit and d-dimensional quantum systems.

We show that, when considering entropy production generated in a process taking a finite-size bipartite quantum system out of equilibrium through local non-unitary channels, no general monotonicity relationship exists between the entropy production and degree of quantum coherence in the state of the system. A direct correspondence between such quantities can be retrieved when considering specific forms of open-system dynamics applied to suitably chosen initial states. Our results call for a systematic study of the role of genuine quantum features in the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum processes.},

  abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in terms of entropy production, which can be used to quantify the degree of irreversibility of a process. In this Chapter, we consider the standard scenario of open quantum systems, where a system irreversibly interacts with an external environment. We show that the standard approach, based on von Neumann entropy, can be replaced by a phase-space formulation of the problem. In particular, we focus on spin systems that can be described using the so-called spin coherent states. We deploy this formalism to study the interplay between the entropy production rate and the initial quantum coherence available to the system.},

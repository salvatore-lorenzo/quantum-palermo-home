      abstract ={We present a machine learning-based approach for characterising the environment that affects the dynamics of an open quantum system. We focus on the case of an exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment interaction, whose strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure dephasing. By using artificial neural networks trained on the Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables of the system, we perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters of the spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law. Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter estimation, highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for probing environmental features in quantum systems and advancing quantum noise spectroscopy.},

    abstract = {We investigate the entanglement properties in the symmetric subspace of N-partite d-dimensional systems (qudits). As it happens already for bipartite diagonal symmetric states, also in the multipartite case the local dimension d plays a crucial role. Here, we demonstrate that there is no bound entanglement for d = 3, 4 and N = 3. Using different techniques, we present strong analytical evidence that no bound entanglement exist for any N if d ≤ 4. Interestingly, bound entanglement of diagonal symmetric states exist for any number of parties, N ≥ 2, and local dimensions d ≥ 5.},

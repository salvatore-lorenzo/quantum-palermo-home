  abstract = {A 3D advection-diffusion-reaction model is proposed to investigate the abundance of phytoplankton in a difficult-to-access ecosystem such as the Gulf of Sirte (southern Mediterranean Sea) characterized by oligotrophic waters. The model exploits experimentally measured environmental variables to reproduce the dynamics of four populations that dominate phytoplankton community in the studied area: Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus HL, Prochlorococcus LL and picoeukaryotes. The theoretical results obtained for phytoplankton abundances are converted into chl-a and Dvchl-a concentrations, and the simulated vertical chlorophyll profiles are compared to the corresponding experimentally acquired data during the MedSudMed-08 oceanographic survey. Non parametric tests showed that the 3D model successfully simulates the spatial distribution of chlorophyll in most of the Gulf of Sirte. Statistical analysis indicates that about 80\% of the simulated chlorophyll vertical profiles are not significantly different from the experimental data. This model is also a useful tool to predict chlorophyll distributions in hard-to-access areas, where experimental data cannot be collected. Moreover, the model could be used to predict the effects of global warming on phytoplankton dynamics and primary production in marine ecosystems. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The spatiotemporal variability of the mercury concentration in both seawater ([HgD]) and the first layers of bottom sediments ([HgsedD] and [HgsedT]), as well as the Hg fluxes at the boundaries of the 3D model domain, have been theoretically reproduced, showing acceptable agreement with the experimental data collected in multiple field observations during six different oceanographic cruises. Also, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the total mercury concentration in seawater have been obtained by using both model results and field observations. The mass balance of the total Hg species in seawater has been calculated for the Augusta Harbour, improving previous estimations. The HR3DHG model could be used as an effective tool to predict the spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved and total mercury concentrations, while contributing to better assessing hazards for the environment and therefore for human health in highly polluted areas. {\copyright} 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

In this regard, the Quality Index Method (QIM) was proposed as a suitable scoring system for freshness and quality sensorial estimation of fishery products. This study aims to develop a deterministic mathematical model based on dynamic temperatures conditions and a suc-cessive statistical analysis of the results obtained. This model will be exploited to predict the shelf-life of the Atlantic mackerel based on specific storage temperatures. A total of 60 fresh fishes were subdivided into two groups and respectively stored in ice for 12 days at a constant temperature of 1{\textpm}0.5{$^\circ$}C (Group A) and a fluctuating temperature ranging between 1 and 7{$^\circ$}C (Group B). Microbiological analysis and sensory evaluation through the QIM were performed on each fish at regular time inter-vals. A critical value of 6 Log cfu/g of spoilage bacteria (mainly psychotropic) associated with a significant decay of the sensorial characteristics was exceeded after 9 days of storage for Group A and 3 days for Group B. A reliable prediction of fish freshness was obtained by modelling the QIM as a function of the spoilage bacteria behaviour. A coefficient {$\beta$} of correlation was determined to convert the spoilage bacteria load into a Quality Index score. The adoption of mathematical predictive models to assess microbial behaviour under different environmental conditions is an interest-ing tool for food industries to maximize production and reduce waste. {\copyright} the Author(s), 2022.},

Given this result, effects of randomly fluctuating irradiance on the population dynamics of a marine ecosystem are studied on the basis of the stochastic 0-dimensional biogeochemical flux model. The noisy fluctuations of the irradiance are formally described as a multiplicative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, that is a self-correlated Gaussian noise. Nonmonotonic behaviours of the variance of the marine populations' biomass are found with respect to the intensity and the autocorrelation time of the noise source, manifesting a noise-induced transition of the ecosystem to an out-of-equilibrium steady state. Moreover, evidence of noise-induced effects on the organic carbon cycling processes underlying the food web dynamics are highlighted. The reported results clearly show the profound impact the stochastic environmental variables can have on both the populations and the biogeochemistry at the basis of a marine trophic network. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The resistive switching and synaptic behavior of a fabricated Ti/HfO2/Pt crossbar array device are investigated. The results demonstrated that TiOx layers are created by the movement of oxygen ions during the positive SET process, thereby improving the endurance and multilevel switching behavior of the device. The random properties of SET process were described with the help of stochastic model of memristor based on the length of conductive filament. The analysis of the mean first passage time allows estimating the parameters of the dielectric switching layer such as the activation energy of the diffusive defects, its variation under the influence of the driving voltage and the value of the working temperature. Furthermore, the conductive mechanism of the Ti/HfO2/Pt device with temperature variations and Schottky emission fitting was studied. Furthermore, the potentiation, depression, and the spike-time dependent plasticity behavior of the Ti/HfO2/Pt devices have been demonstrated by well-designed pulse inputs. The observed gradual change in conductance is suitable for a synaptic device in a neuromorphic system. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {We present a new stochastic model, based on a 0-dimensional version of the well known biogeochemical flux model (BFM), which allows to take into account the temperature random fluctuations present in natural systems and therefore to describe more realistically the dynamics of real marine ecosystems. The study presents a detailed analysis of the effects of randomly varying temperature on the lower trophic levels of the food web and ocean biogeochemical processes. More in detail, the temperature is described as a stochastic process driven by an additive self-correlated Gaussian noise. Varying both correlation time and intensity of the noise source, the predominance of different plankton populations is observed, with regimes shifted towards the coexistence or the exclusion of some populations. Finally a Fourier analysis carried out on the time series of the plankton populations shows how the ecosystem responds to the seasonal driving for different values of the noise intensity. {\copyright} 2021},

  abstract = {We study a generic time-dependent Jaynes--Cummings model, discovering universal features of its time evolution on a dynamical time scale which is here defined as an integral over time of the field-atom coupling strength modulus. Using the total excitation number as a constant of motion and the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian, we decompose the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the system in a one-dimensional and an infinite number of two-dimensional dynamically invariant subspaces, in which the dynamical problem is solved using the Messina--Nakazato parameterization method. Therefore, we obtain a solution of the dynamics over the full Hilbert space. Its application to the evolution of the atomic population inversion over the dynamical time, under different initial conditions, highlights Rabi-like oscillations and revivals, which do not depend on the functional dependence of the Hamiltonian parameters on time and can be controlled by a crucial parameter in the solution. The universal dynamical features brought to light in this study assume particular significance in this quantum computing era, where general quantum simulators are of great use. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Societ{\`a} Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Despite the observation of cyclic and chaotic dynamics in nature, it is still not clear whether this behaviour is inherent to ecological systems or caused by external forcings. Here we explored a set of approximately 210,000 simulations to assess how often a model of realistic complexity exhibits non-stationary dynamics when external perturbations are excluded. Remarkably, less than one third of the population shown non-stationary dynamics and, even when present, fluctuations were rather small. The inherent stability of plankton communities showed to be related to the presence of multiple feedbacks in the food web structure, omnivory, low centre of gravity, and supports the conclusion that food webs of realistic complexity rarely exhibit significant endogenous non-stationary dynamics. Finally, we computed Lyapunov exponents for the non-stationary trajectories, in order to assess in which proportion they were periodic or chaotic, and we concluded that less than 10\% of the non-stationary trajectories (3\% of the total) showed sensitivities to initial conditions. This further supports the conclusion that complex topology mainly damps endogenous fluctuations in the food web. {\copyright} 2023 The Author(s)},

Three main areas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics will be covered: slow relaxation phenomena and dissipative dynamics; long-range interactions and classical systems; quantum systems.

  abstract = {We investigate the constructive role of an external noise signal, in the form of a low-rate Poisson sequence of pulses supplied to all inputs of a spiking neural network, consisting in maintaining for a long time or even recovering a memory trace (engram) of the image without its direct renewal (or rewriting). In particular, this unique dynamic property is demonstrated in a single-layer spiking neural network consisting of simple integrate-and-fire neurons and memristive synaptic weights. This is carried out by preserving and even fine-tuning the conductance values of memristors in terms of dynamic plasticity, specifically spike-timing-dependent plasticity-type, driven by overlapping pre- and postsynaptic voltage spikes. It has been shown that the weights can be to a certain extent unreliable, due to such characteristics as the limited retention time of resistive state or the variation of switching voltages. Such a noise-assisted persistence of memory, on one hand, could be a prototypical mechanism in a biological nervous system and, on the other hand, brings one step closer to the possibility of building reliable spiking neural networks composed of unreliable analog elements. {\copyright} 2021},

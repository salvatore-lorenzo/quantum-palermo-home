PhD student at the University of Palermo (UNIPA) as part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) SPARKLE doctoral network, under the supervision of Prof. Umberto De Giovannini (UNIPA). I received my BCs and MSc degree in Physics from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki(AuTH). My work is focused on developing methods to simulate Time-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy within the TD-DFT framework.

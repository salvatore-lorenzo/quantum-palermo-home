I completed my BSc in Theoretical Physics from the University of Sarajevo (2023) and my MSc in Physics and Photonics (2025) through Erasmus Mundus Master's program LASCALA (Large Scale Accelerators and Lasers), jointly hosted by Université Paris-Saclay, Lund University, Sapienza University of Rome, and the University of Szeged. I am now a PhD student at the University of Palermo within the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Doctoral Network SPARKLE, supervised by Prof. Umberto De Giovanni. My PhD focuses on developing time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with quantum light, using ab initio and computational approaches to explore ultrafast light-matter interactions.

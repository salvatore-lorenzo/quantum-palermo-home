I received my Bachelor's degree in 2022 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I have been pursuing my PhD in Physics at HUST since 2022. Currently,  I am a visiting student at the University of Palermo within the Graduate Short-Term Study Abroad Program in HUST, supervised by Prof. Umberto De Giovannini. My PhD focuses on exploring non-equilibrium electron dynamics.

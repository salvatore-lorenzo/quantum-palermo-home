I am originally coming from Latvia where I finished my physics bachelor studies at the University of Latvia. I did my master’s thesis in electrical engineering at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), but my master's thesis was a theoretical investigation of the photon Bose-Einstein condensate in disordered media. 

I recently defended my Ph.D. thesis at the University of Freiburg under Prof. Stefan Yoshi Buhmann where for the most part I theoretically investigated the steady-state properties of the photon condensates. I also did an internship at the University of Bonn under Prof. Martin Weitz and Prof. Julian Schmitt where I experimentally investigated time-dependent condensate dynamics.

My scientific interests outside my main research include chaos theory, fractals, random processes, and how they are all connected. Outside of science, my other occupation is producing electronic music.

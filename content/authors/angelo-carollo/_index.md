Angelo completed his PhD in quantum optics and quantum information in 2004 at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Vlatko Vedral. He has been a postdoctoral fellow in at the University of Cambridge under Artur Ekert and a Marie Curie fellow at the University of Innsbruck under Peter Zoller. After an experience in the financial industry in London, he joined the University of Palermo in 2010 as a research fellow where he is now Associate Professor. His current research interests range from Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological properties in condensed matter and quantum optics,  quantum metrology, and equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum statistical physics.

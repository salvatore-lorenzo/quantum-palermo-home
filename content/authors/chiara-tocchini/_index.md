I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Physics from the University of Pisa, where I worked on quantum thermal machines in multi-qubit systems and their implementation on quantum computers. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Quantum Artificial Intelligence at the University of Palermo, in collaboration with Fondazione Ri.MED. My research focuses on the application of quantum AI to biology and computational chemistry.

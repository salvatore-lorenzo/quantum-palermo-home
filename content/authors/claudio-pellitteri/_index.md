Short bio

I was born in Palermo in 1993. Driven by a fascination for nature and its laws, I decided to pursue a degree in Physics at the University of Palermo. It is here that I became passionate about quantum mechanics. Currently, I am nearing the completion of my doctoral research, supervised by professors G. Massimo Palma and Salvatore Lorenzo, while also collaborating with others.

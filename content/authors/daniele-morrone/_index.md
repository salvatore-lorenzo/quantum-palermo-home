I obtained my Master’s degree in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Francesco Plastina, with a thesis on the thermodynamic properties of collisional models. Subsequently, I began a PhD at the University of Milan under the supervision of Prof. Marco G. Genoni. During my PhD, my research focused on topics such as quantum batteries, the thermodynamics of continuously-monitored open quantum systems and Landauer’s Principle, which characterizes the thermodynamic cost of information processing.
After completing my PhD, I moved to Palermo to further explore the irreversibility costs associated with quantum computation processes.

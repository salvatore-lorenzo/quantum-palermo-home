I graduated from University of Palermo in 2023, where I subsequently joined the group of my thesis advisor Prof. Ciccarello. My Master’s Thesis was conducted partly during a stay at the Institute of Fundamental Physics, where I had the chance to work on “Quantum Optics near a Flat Band” together with Dr. A. Gonzalez-Tudela. My interests span a broad are of subjects, primarily (topological) photonics but also solid-state physics in its entirety. When I’m not working, most likely I am either listening to music or spending some quality time with my dog.

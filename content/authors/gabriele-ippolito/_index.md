I graduated in physics from the University of Palermo in 2025, where I subsequently joined the research group of my thesis advisor Prof. F. Ciccarello. My master’s thesis was conducted at the Walther Meissner Institut (WMI) in Garching, Munich, in collaboration with Dr. Peter Rabl, and focused on the study of the “two-photon emission dynamics in photonic lattices with quadratic light-matter interaction”. My research interests lie primarily in the areas of quantum optics and solid-state physics.

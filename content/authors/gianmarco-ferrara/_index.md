I studied Physics at the University of Bologna, earning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2023 and my Master’s Degree in 2025. My main research interests include the foundations of quantum theory, quantum information, and quantum machine learning. In 2025, I started my PhD at the University of Palermo, where I’m working on quantum reservoir computing under the supervision of Prof. Mauro Paternostro, Prof. Salvatore Lorenzo and Prof. Gabriele Lo Monaco.

My present area of research centers on quantum metrology and quantum phase transitions. Within the domain of quantum metrology, I investigate the prospective enhancements in metrological precision provided by critical systems. Typically, my research employs a combination of computational and analytical methodologies. My work is particularly focused on spin chains and fermionic models, both in closed and open situations.

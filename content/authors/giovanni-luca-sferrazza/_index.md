I am a PhD student at the University of Palermo, working under the guidance of Prof. F. Ciccarello. My fascination with theoretical physics spans a wide range of topics, including topological phases of matter, topological quantum optics, and the theory of open quantum systems.  I focus on exploring their interplay to uncover potential applications in quantum technologies, aiming to bridge fundamental physics with innovative technological advancements.

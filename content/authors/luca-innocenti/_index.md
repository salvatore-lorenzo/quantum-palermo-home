Luca is a researcher in the at the Department of Physics and Chemistry of the University of Palermo. He completed his PhD in quantum machine learning and quantum information theory at Queen’s University Belfast in 2021 under the supervision of Mauro Paternostro and Alessandro Ferraro. He did a postdoc period in Olomouc working on methods to detect nonclassicality in quantum optical experiments with Radim Filip, and then moved to the University of Palermo. His research interests include quantum machine learning, with a focus on quantum reservoir computing and quantum extreme learning machines, quantum metrology, and foundational topics such as quantum Darwinism and quantum information scrambling.

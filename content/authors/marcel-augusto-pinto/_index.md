I was born in Três Pontas, Brazil, and completed my bachelor's degree at Universidade Federal de Alagoas. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on the study of anticipated synchronization on a circuit of Izhikevich neurons. Afterward, I pursued a Master's degree from the same institution, where I researched the scattering of polychromatic light on a classical PT-symmetric material. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Palermo under the guidance of Prof. Francesco Ciccarello. My research is focused simulating and studying the emission behavior of a giant atom coupled to a graphene-like photonic bath.

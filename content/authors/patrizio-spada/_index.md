Patrizio Spada is a PhD student in Quantum Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Physics and Chemistry of the University of Palermo. He earned his bachelor's degree in 2018 in Fisica, in Italian language, and his master's degree in 2023 in Physics, in English language, both at the University of Bari. His master's thesis "Entanglement complexity and frustration" was completed under the guidance of the Professors Saverio Pascazio and Angelo Mariano. By means of numerical simulations run on ENEA's HPC systems, the thesis explores the entanglement and the quantum frustration within the qubits ensembles. This work was conducted in parallel with an internship at the Bari division of the INFN covering the XY model on the circle. After an extracurricular internship at Lutech Advanced Solutions in Bari, Spada moved to Ferrara in 2024 to work at INFN as a research fellow on the project named "Quantum algorithms to evaluate creditworthiness" under the supervision of Professor Concezio Bozzi.

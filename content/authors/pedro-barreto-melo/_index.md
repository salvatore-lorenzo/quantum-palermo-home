Short bio
I was born in Teresina, Brazil, and completed my bachelor's degree in Physics at Universidade Federal do Piauí in 2021. After that, I completed my masters degree in Physics at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 2023, where I studied one-dimensional topological insulators with interaction, with the prize scholarship FAPERJ "Nota 10". <br> In 2023 I started my PhD at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, where I am a PhD candidate now. From September/2025 to February/2026, I am a PhD visiting student at Università degli Studi di Palermo within the Brazilian funding agency CAPES, under the supervision of Professor Mauro Paternostro. My PhD focuses in Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics, as well as Thermodynamics of Information. I am also interested in non-Hermitian topological insulators and quantum metrology.

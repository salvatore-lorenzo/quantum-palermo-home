I was born in Udine, in Northern Italy, in 1998. I have been fascinated by the scientific and natural world since I was a kid and after high school I decided to study Physics at University of Trieste to pursue a career in research. There I developed my passion for math, the scientific method and in particular I was attracted by quantum physics, statistical mechanics and complex systems, appreciating the variety of fields that physics allowed me to study. Now I am continuing my career as a PhD student at the University of Palermo where I am working on two projects, supervised by Prof. Lorenzo and Prof. Paternostro and with the collaboration of many others.

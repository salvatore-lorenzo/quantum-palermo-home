I graduated in Physics at the University of Palermo in 2019 and pursued my PhD in Belfast under the supervision of Prof. Mauro Paternostro. My PhD focussed on the application of Machine Learning based techniques, in particular Reinforcement Learning, for optimal control and design of quantum systems. I am currently interested in Machine Learning, Quantum Control, Thermodynamics of Quantum Systems and the overlap between them. My work in Palermo focusses on Quantum Reservoir Computing, with particular interest in the energy cost of computation and characterization of the dynamics of the systems of interest.

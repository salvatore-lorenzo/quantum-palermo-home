I am a PhD student at the University of Palermo, jointly with nodeQ (York), and advised by Prof. Mauro Paternostro. During my master’s degree, I was part of the International Centre for Theory of Quantum Technologies, where I worked on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols and Bell tests. In my master’s thesis, we introduced high dimensional SARG04 QKD protocols for high loss channels. Currently, I’m interested in more general quantum communication tasks and device independent security. Apart from research, I like music, playing basketball and travelling.

Umberto is Assistant Professor at the Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of Palermo and Group leader at the Max Planck Institute For the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) of Hamburg Germany. He obtained his PhD in 2008 (UniGE), was postdoctoral fellow at the University of the Basque Country in Spain (2010-2016) and Group Leader at MPSD in Germany (since 2017).
He authored 80+ papers on high impact journals attracting 4000+ citations and EU funds for € 500K+.
His research interest lie at the intersection between condensed matter, quantum chemistry, strong-field physics and strong light-matter coupling. He has made extensive contributions to the development of theoretical and ab-initio numerical methods, significantly advancing our understanding of phenomena in this interdisciplinary field.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in 2018 from Beijing Normal University. In 2024, I completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Sheng Meng at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My doctoral research focused on utilizing state-of-the-art time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to manipulate phase transitions in condensed matter systems, particularly in charge density wave systems. Currently, under the supervision of Prof. De Giovannini, I am working on combining TDDFT with open quantum systems to address a significant gap in understanding solid-state dynamics from first principles.

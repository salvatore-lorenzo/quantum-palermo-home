          The interplay of correlated, and coherent behavior in electrons, spins, photons, and nuclei within materials holds the key to unlocking a new era of quantum technologies. By delving into the ultrafast dynamics of these systems under non-equilibrium conditions, we can pave the way for breakthroughs in quantum computing, information storage, energy-efficient light-emitting devices, and single-photon sources.
          The TIMES doctoral network aims to achieve a novel paradigm for simulating non-equilibrium processes at the atomic level within condensed matter. This field currently struggles with limited predictive power. Current approaches, whether based on first-principles or more phenomenological ones, lack the necessary detail to capture the intricate evolution of complex materials.

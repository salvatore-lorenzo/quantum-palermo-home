abstract: An option to overcome the limits of electronics are excitons, quasi-particles
  generated by the electron-hole Coulomb interaction. A fundamental prerequisite is
  the possibility to control their properties with optical fields. We adopted attosecond
  reflection spectroscopy to investigate the interplay between core excitons and ultrashort
  infrared pulses in MgF2. Their ultrafast response is divided into two contributions,
  unfolding on different time scales, related to the exciton dual nature. Namely,
  we discern the atomic-like behaviour, dominating the few-femtosecond response, from
  the excitonic solid-like characteristics, with sub-femtosecond timing. Theoretical
  models highlight the role of the exciton binding energy in dictating their optical
  response.

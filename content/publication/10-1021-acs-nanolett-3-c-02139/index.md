abstract: We study low-frequency linearly polarized laser-dressing in materials with
  valley (graphene and hexagonal-Boron-Nitride) and topological (Dirac- and Weyl-semimetals)
  properties. In Dirac-like linearly dispersing bands, the laser substantially moves
  the Dirac nodes away from their original position, and the movement direction can
  be fully controlled by rotating the laser polarization. We prove that this effect
  originates from band nonlinearities away from the Dirac nodes. We further demonstrate
  that this physical mechanism is widely applicable and can move the positions of
  the valley minima in hexagonal materials to tune valley selectivity, split and move
  Weyl cones in higher-order Weyl semimetals, and merge Dirac nodes in three-dimensional
  Dirac semimetals. The model results are validated with ab initio calculations. Our
  results directly affect efforts for exploring light-dressed electronic structure,
  suggesting that one can benefit from band nonlinearity for tailoring material properties,
  and highlight the importance of the full band structure in nonlinear optical phenomena
  in solids.

abstract: Irradiating solids with ultrashort laser pulses is known to initiate femtosecond
  timescale magnetization dynamics. However, sub-femtosecond spin dynamics have not
  yet been observed or predicted. Here, we explore ultrafast light-driven spin dynamics
  in a highly nonresonant strong-field regime. Through state-of-the-art ab initio
  calculations, we predict that a nonmagnetic material can transiently transform into
  a magnetic one via dynamical extremely nonlinear spin-flipping processes, which
  occur on attosecond timescales and are mediated by cascaded multi-photon and spin–orbit
  interactions. These are nonperturbative nonresonant analogs to the inverse Faraday
  effect, allowing the magnetization to evolve in very high harmonics of the laser
  frequency (e.g. here up to the 42nd, oscillating at ~100 attoseconds), and providing
  control over the speed of magnetization by tuning the laser power and wavelength.
  Remarkably, we show that even for linearly polarized driving, where one does not
  intuitively expect the onset of an induced magnetization, the magnetization transiently
  oscillates as the system interacts with light. This response is enabled by transverse
  light-driven currents in the solid, and typically occurs on timescales of ~500 attoseconds
  (with the slower femtosecond response suppressed). An experimental setup capable
  of measuring these dynamics through pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy
  is simulated. Our results pave the way for attosecond regimes of manipulation of
  magnetism.

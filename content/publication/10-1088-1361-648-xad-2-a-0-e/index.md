abstract: Floquet engineering has recently emerged as a technique for controlling
  material properties with light. Floquet phases can be probed with time- and angle-resolved
  photoelectron spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES), providing direct access to the laser-dressed
  electronic bands. Applications of Tr-ARPES to date focused on observing the Floquet-Bloch
  bands themselves, and their build-up and dephasing on sub-laser-cycle timescales.
  However, momentum and energy resolved sub-laser-cycle dynamics between Floquet bands
  have not been analyzed. Given that Floquet theory strictly applies in time-periodic
  conditions, the notion of resolving sub-laser-cycle dynamics between Floquet states
  seems contradictory - it requires probe pulse durations below a laser cycle that
  inherently cannot discern the time-periodic nature of the light-matter system. Here
  we propose to employ attosecond pulse train probes with the same temporal periodicity
  as the Floquet-dressing pump pulse, allowing both attosecond sub-laser-cycle resolution
  and a proper projection of Tr-ARPES spectra on the Floquet-Bloch bands. We formulate
  and employ this approach in ab-initio calculations in light-driven graphene. Our
  calculations predict significant sub-laser-cycle dynamics occurring within the Floquet
  phase with the majority of electrons moving within and in-between Floquet bands,
  and a small portion residing and moving outside of them in what we denote as Å‰on-Floquet'
  bands. We establish that non-Floquet bands arise from the pump laser envelope that
  induces non-adiabatic electronic excitations during the pulse turn-on and turn-off.
  By performing calculations in systems with poly-chromatic pumps we also show that
  Floquet states are not formed on a sub-laser-cycle level. This work indicates that
  the Floquet-Bloch states are generally not a complete basis set for sub-laser-cycle
  dynamics in steady-state phases of matter.

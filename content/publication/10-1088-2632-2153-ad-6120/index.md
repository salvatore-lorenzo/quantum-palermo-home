abstract: 'Quantum machine learning algorithms are expected to play a pivotal role
  in quantum chemistry simulations in the immediate future. One of such key applications
  is the training of a quantum neural network to learn the potential energy surface
  and force field of molecular systems. We address this task by using the quantum
  extreme learning machine paradigm. This particular supervised learning routine allows
  for a resource efficient training, consisting of a simple linear regression performed
  on a classical computer. We have tested a setup that can be used to study molecules
  of any dimension and optimized for immediate use on NISQ devices with a limited
  number of native gates. We have applied this setup to three case studies: lithium
  hydride, water, and formamide, carrying out both noiseless simulations and actual
  implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Compared to other supervised learning routines,
  the proposed setup requires minimal quantum resources, making it feasible for direct
  implementation on quantum platforms, while still achieving a high level of predictive
  accuracy compared to simulations. Our encouraging results pave the way towards the
  future application to more complex molecules, being the proposed setup scalable.'

abstract: 'We demonstrate that the electronic structure of a material can be deformed
  into Floquet pseudobands with arbitrarily tailored shapes. We achieve this goal
  with a combination of quantum optimal control theory and Floquet engineering. The
  power and versatility of this framework is demonstrated here by utilizing the independent-electron
  tight-binding description of the π electronic system of graphene. We show several
  prototype examples focusing on the region around the K (Dirac) point of the Brillouin
  zone: creation of a gap with opposing flat valence and conduction bands, creation
  of a gap with opposing concave symmetric valence and conduction bands (which would
  correspond to a material with an effective negative electron-hole mass), and closure
  of the gap when departing from a modified graphene model with a nonzero field-free
  gap. We employ time-periodic drives with several frequency components and polarizations,
  in contrast to the usual monochromatic fields, and use control theory to find the
  amplitudes of each component that optimize the shape of the bands as desired. In
  addition, we use quantum control methods to find realistic switch-on pulses that
  bring the material into the predefined stationary Floquet band structure, i.e.,
  into a state in which the desired Floquet modes of the target bands are fully occupied,
  so that they should remain stroboscopically stationary, with long lifetimes, when
  the weak periodic drives are started. Finally, we note that although we have focused
  on solid state materials, the technique that we propose could be equally used for
  the Floquet engineering of ultracold atoms in optical lattices and for other nonequilibrium
  dynamical and correlated systems.'

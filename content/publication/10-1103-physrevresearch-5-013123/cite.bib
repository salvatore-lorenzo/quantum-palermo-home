 abstract = {We report on the strong field ionization of H2 by a corotating two-color laser field. We measure the electron momentum distribution in coincidence with the kinetic energy release (KER) of dissociating hydrogen molecules. In addition to a characteristic half-moon structure, we observe a low-energy structure in the electron momentum distribution at a KER of about 3.5 eV. We speculate that the outgoing electron interacts with the molecular ion, despite the absence of classical recollisions under these conditions. Time-dependent density functional theory simulations support our conclusions.},

abstract: 'Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a method that measures
  orbital and band structure contrast through the momentum distribution of photoelectrons.
  Its simplest interpretation is obtained in the plane-wave approximation, according
  to which photoelectrons propagate freely to the detector. The photoelectron momentum
  distribution is then essentially given by the Fourier transform of the real-space
  orbital. While the plane-wave approximation is remarkably successful in describing
  the momentum distributions of aromatic compounds, it generally fails to capture
  kinetic-energy-dependent final-state interference and dichroism effects. Focusing
  our present study on quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene as the archetypical two-dimensional
  (2D) material, we observe an exemplary Ekin-dependent modulation of, and a redistribution
  of spectral weight within, its characteristic horseshoe signature around the K¯
  and K¯′ points: both effects indeed cannot be rationalized by the plane-wave final
  state. Our data are, however, in remarkable agreement with ab initio time-dependent
  density functional simulations of a freestanding graphene layer and can be explained
  by a simple extension of the plane-wave final state, permitting the two dipole-allowed
  partial waves emitted from the C 2pz orbitals to scatter in the potential of their
  immediate surroundings. Exploiting the absolute photon flux calibration of the Metrology
  Light Source, this scattered-wave approximation allows us to extract Ekin-dependent
  amplitudes and phases of both partial waves directly from photoemission data. The
  scattered-wave approximation thus represents a powerful yet intuitive refinement
  of the plane-wave final state in photoemission of 2D materials and beyond.'

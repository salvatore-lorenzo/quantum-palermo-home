abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) has developed in recent years as a promising
  tool for ultrafast materials spectroscopy. At the forefront of these advancements,
  several works proposed using HHG as an all-optical probe for topology of quantum
  matter by identifying its signatures in the emission spectra. However, it remains
  unclear if such spectral signatures are indeed a robust and general approach for
  probing topology. To address this point, we perform a fully ab initio study of HHG
  from prototypical two-dimensional topological insulators in the Kane-Mele quantum
  spin-Hall and anomalous-Hall phases. We analyze the spectra and previously proposed
  topological signatures by comparing HHG from the topological and trivial phases
  and across the phase transition. We demonstrate and provide detailed microscopic
  explanations of why, in these systems, none of the observables proposed thus far
  uniquely and universally probes material topology. Specifically, we find that the
  (i) HHG helicity, (ii) anomalous HHG ellipticity, (iii) HHG elliptical dichroism,
  and (iv) temporal delays in HHG emission are all unreliable signatures of topological
  phases. Our results suggest that extreme care must be taken when interpreting HHG
  spectra for topological signatures and that contributions from the crystal symmetries
  and chemical nature might be dominant over those from topology. They hint that a
  truly universal topological signature in nonlinear optics is unlikely and raise
  important questions regarding possible utilization and detection of topology in
  out-of-equilibrium systems.

abstract: Metals are canonical plasmonic media at infrared and optical wavelengths,
  allowing one to guide and manipulate light at the nanoscale. A special form of optical
  waveguiding is afforded by highly anisotropic crystals revealing the opposite signs
  of the dielectric functions along orthogonal directions. These media are classified
  as hyperbolic and include crystalline insulators, semiconductors, and artificial
  metamaterials. Layered anisotropic metals are also anticipated to support hyperbolic
  waveguiding. However, this behavior remains elusive, primarily because interband
  losses arrest the propagation of infrared modes. Here, we report on the observation
  of propagating hyperbolic waves in a prototypical layered nodal-line semimetal ZrSiSe.
  The observed waveguiding originates from polaritonic hybridization between near-infrared
  light and nodal-line plasmons. Unique nodal electronic structures simultaneously
  suppress interband loss and boost the plasmonic response, ultimately enabling the
  propagation of infrared modes through the bulk of the crystal.

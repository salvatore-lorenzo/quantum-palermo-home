abstract: Crossing a quantum critical point in finite time challenges the adiabatic
  condition due to the closing of the energy gap, which ultimately results in the
  formation of excitations. Such non-adiabatic excitations are typically deemed detrimental
  in many scenarios, and consequently several strategies have been put forward to
  circumvent their formation. Here, however, we show how these non-adiabatic excitations
  -- originated from the failure to meet the adiabatic condition due to the presence
  of a quantum critical point -- can be controlled and thus harnessed to perform certain
  tasks advantageously. We focus on closed cycles reaching the quantum critical point
  of fully-connected models analyzing two examples. First, a quantum battery that
  is loaded by approaching a quantum critical point, whose stored and extractable
  work increases exponentially via repeating cycles. Second, a scheme for the fast
  preparation of spin squeezed states containing multipartite entanglement that offer
  a metrological advantage. The corresponding figure of merit in both cases crucially
  depends on universal critical exponents and the scaling of the protocol driving
  the system in the vicinity of the transition. Our results highlight the rich interplay
  between quantum thermodynamics and metrology with critical nonequilibrium dynamics.

abstract: We propose a stochastic model for a memristive system by generalizing known
  approaches and experimental results. We validate our theoretical model by experiments
  carried out on a memristive device based on multilayer structure. In the framework
  of the proposed model we obtain the exact analytic expressions for stationary and
  nonstationary solutions. We analyze the equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady-state
  distributions of the internal state variable of the memristive system and study
  the influence of fluctuations on the resistive switching, including the relaxation
  time to the steady-state. The relaxation time shows a nonmonotonic dependence, with
  a minimum, on the intensity of the fluctuations. This paves the way for using the
  intensity of fluctuations as a control parameter for switching dynamics in memristive
  devices.

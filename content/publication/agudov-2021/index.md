abstract: We propose a stochastic model of a voltage controlled bipolar memristive
  system, which includes the properties of widely used dynamic SPICE models and takes
  into account the fluctuations inherent in memristors. The proposed model is described
  by rather simple equations of Brownian diffusion, does not require significant computational
  resources for numerical modeling, and allows obtaining the exact analytical solutions
  in some cases. The noise-induced transient bimodality phenomenon, arising under
  resistive switching, was revealed and investigated theoretically and experimentally
  in a memristive system, by finding a quite good qualitatively agreement between
  theory and experiment. Based on the proposed model, the mathematical apparatus of
  Markov processes for the first passage time of the boundaries can be used to analyse
  the temporal characteristics of resistive switching.

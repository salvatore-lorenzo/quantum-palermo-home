abstract: Dynamic manipulation of magnetism in topological materials is demonstrated
  here via a Floquet engineering approach using circularly polarized light. Increasing
  the strength of the laser field, besides the expected topological phase transition
  (PT), the magnetically doped topological insulator thin film also undergoes a magnetic
  PT from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism, whose critical behavior strongly depends
  on the quantum quenching. In sharp contrast to the equilibrium case, the non-equilibrium
  Curie temperatures vary for different time scale and experimental setup, not all
  relying on change of topology. Our discoveries deepen the understanding of the relationship
  between topology and magnetism in the non-equilibrium regime and extend optoelectronic
  device applications to topological materials.

abstract: It has recently been claimed that a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal
  index of 4d N=4 SYM accounts for the entropy function, whose Legendre transform
  corresponds to the entropy of the holographic dual AdS5 rotating black hole. Here
  we study this Cardy-like limit for N=1 toric quiver gauge theories, observing that
  the corresponding entropy function can be interpreted in terms of the toric data.
  Furthermore, for some families of models, we compute the Legendre transform of the
  entropy function, comparing with similar results recently discussed in the literature.

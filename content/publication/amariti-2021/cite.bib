 abstract = {It has recently been claimed that a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index of 4d N=4 SYM accounts for the entropy function, whose Legendre transform corresponds to the entropy of the holographic dual AdS5 rotating black hole. Here we study this Cardy-like limit for N=1 toric quiver gauge theories, observing that the corresponding entropy function can be interpreted in terms of the toric data. Furthermore, for some families of models, we compute the Legendre transform of the entropy function, comparing with similar results recently discussed in the literature.},

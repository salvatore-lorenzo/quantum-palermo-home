abstract: The search for strategies to harness the temperature of quantum systems
  is one of the main goals in quantum thermodynamics. Here we study the dynamics of
  a system made of a pair of quantum harmonic oscillators, represented by single-mode
  cavity fields, interacting with a thermally excited beam of phaseonium atoms, which
  act as ancillas. The two cavities are arranged in a cascade configuration, so that
  the second cavity interacts with phaseonium atoms only after their interaction with
  the first one. We provide exact closed dynamics of the first cavity for arbitrarily
  long interaction times. We highlight the role played by the characteristic coherence
  phase of phaseonium atoms in determining the steady states of the cavity fields
  as well as that of the ancillas. Also, we show how the second cavity follows a non-Markovian
  evolution due to interactions with the \"used\" ancillary atoms, that enables information
  exchange with the first cavity. Adjusting the parameters of the phaseonium atoms,
  we can determine the final stable temperature reached by the cavities. In this way,
  the cavities can be heated up as well as cooled down. These results provide useful
  insights towards the use of different types of ancillas for thermodynamic cycles
  in cavity QED scenarios.

abstract: We present a realistic implementation of a quantum engine powered by a phaseonium
  gas of coherently prepared three-level atoms -- where quantum coherence acts as
  a thermodynamic resource. Using a collision model framework for phaseonium-cavity
  interactions and cavity optomechanics, we construct a full engine cycle based on
  two non-thermal reservoirs, each characterized by coherence-induced effective temperatures.
  This configuration enhances the efficiency of a simple optomechanical engine operating
  beyond standard thermal paradigms. We further address scalability by coupling a
  second cavity in cascade configuration, where the same phaseonium gas drives both
  cycles. Our results demonstrate the operational viability of coherence-driven quantum
  engines and their potential for future thermodynamic applications.

abstract: Some of the recent developments concerning the propagation of quantum correlations
  across spin channels are reviewed. In particular, we focus on the improvement of
  the transport efficiency obtained by the manipulation of few energy parameters (either
  end-bond strengths or local magnetic fields) near the sending and receiving sites.
  We give a physically insightful description of various such schemes and discuss
  the transfer of both entanglement and of quantum discord. oÌ§pyright 2013 World Scientific

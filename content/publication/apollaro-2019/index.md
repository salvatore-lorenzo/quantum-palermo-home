abstract: Generating high-quality multiparticle entanglement between communicating
  parties is the primary resource in quantum teleportation protocols. To this aim,
  we show that the natural dynamics of a single spin chain is able to sustain the
  generation of two pairs of Bell states--possibly shared between a sender and a distant
  receiver-which can in turn enable two-qubit teleportation. In particular, we address
  a spin-12 chain with XX interactions, connecting two pairs of spins located at its
  boundaries, playing the roles of sender and receiver. In the regime where both end
  pairs are weakly coupled to the spin chain, it is possible to generate at predefinite
  times a state that has vanishing infidelity with the product state of two Bell pairs,
  thereby providing nearly unit fidelity of teleportation. We also derive an effective
  Hamiltonian via a second-order perturbation approach that faithfully reproduces
  the dynamics of the full system.

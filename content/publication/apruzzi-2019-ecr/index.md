abstract: AdS7 supersymmetric solutions in type IIA have been classified, and they
  are infinitely many. Moreover, every such solution has a non-supersymmetric sister.
  In this pa- per, we study the perturbative and non-perturbative stability of these
  non-supersymmetric solutions, focusing on cases without orientifolds. Perturbatively,
  we first look at the KK spectrum of spin-2 excitations. This does not exhibit instabilities,
  but it does show that there is no separation of scales for either the BPS and the
  non-BPS case, thus proving for supersymmetric AdS7 a well-known recent conjecture.
  We then use 7d gauged supergravity and a brane polarization computation to access
  part of the spectrum of KK scalars. The result signals an instability for all non-supersymmetric
  solutions except those that have a single D8 on each side. We finally look at non-perturbative
  instabilities, and find that NS5 bubbles make these remaining solutions decay.

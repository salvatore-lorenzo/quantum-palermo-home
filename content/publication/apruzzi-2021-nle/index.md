abstract: We discuss infinite families of non-supersymmetric AdS6 solutions in Type
  IIB string theory. They are siblings of supersymmetric solutions which are associated
  with (p, q) 5-brane webs and holographically dual to 5d SCFTs engineered by those
  brane webs. The non-supersymmetric backgrounds carry identical 5-brane charges and
  are connected to the supersymmetric ones by RG flows. We study the stability of
  the non-supersymmetric solutions, identifying perturbative and non-perturbative
  decay channels for all the backgrounds explicitly available. We also identify likely
  decay mechanisms for solutions that have not been constructed explicitly but may
  be expected to exist based on brane web considerations. Finally, we exclude scale
  separation by constructing universal spin 2 modes with masses comparable to the
  mass-scale of the cosmological constant.

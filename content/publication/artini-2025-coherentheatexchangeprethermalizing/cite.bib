 abstract = {We investigate a simple model exhibiting a prethermal phase, i.e. a metastable state that emerges before full thermalization, through the framework of quantum stochastic thermodynamics. We explore the effects of quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis of the initial state of the system on the process of heat exchange with a bath, and their contribution to entropy production as quantified by a heat-exchange fluctuation theorem. Such relation is derived using the End-Point Measurement (EPM) scheme, a protocol that accounts for initial quantum coherence in the statistics of energy exchanges resulting from a non-equilibrium process. We compare these results with those obtained from the widely used Two-Point Measurement (TPM) scheme which, by construction, fails to capture such quantum effects.},

abstract: We rigorously analyze the non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of various
  formulations of quantum Brownian motion (QBM) using the framework of stochastic
  thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits
  desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance,
  it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely positive
  and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be thermodynamically controversial.
  We show that such extensions introduce anomalous phase-space structures that violate
  detailed balance at the steady state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production
  and effective non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight
  a fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration
  in open quantum systems.

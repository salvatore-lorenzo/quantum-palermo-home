abstract: We investigate the entropy production in the Di√≥si-Penrose (DP) model, one
  of the most extensively studied gravity-related collapse mechanisms, and one of
  its dissipative extensions. To this end, we analyze the behavior of a single harmonic
  oscillator, subjected to such collapse mechanisms, focusing on its phase-space dynamics
  and the time evolution of the entropy production rate, a central quantity in non-equilibrium
  thermodynamics. Our findings reveal that the original DP model induces unbounded
  heating, producing dynamics consistent with the Second Law of thermodynamics only
  under the assumption of an infinite-temperature noise field. In contrast, its dissipative
  extension achieves physically consistent thermalization in the regime of low dissipation
  strength. We further our study to address the complete dynamics of the dissipative
  extension, thus including explicitly non-Gaussian features in the state of the system
  that lack from the low-dissipation regime, using a short-time approach.

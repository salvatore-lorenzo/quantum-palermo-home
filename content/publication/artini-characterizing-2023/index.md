abstract: Abstract We investigate the phenomenology leading to the non-conservation
  of energy of the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model from the viewpoint
  of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and use such framework to assess the equilibration
  process entailed by the dissipative formulation of the model (dCSL). As a paradigmatic
  situation currently addressed in frontier experiments aimed at investigating possible
  collapse theories, we consider a one-dimensional mechanical oscillator in a thermal
  state. We perform our analysis in the phase space of the oscillator, where the entropy
  production rate, a non-equilibrium quantity used to characterize irreversibility,
  can be conveniently analyzed. We show that the CSL model violates Clausius law,
  as it exhibits a negative entropy production rate, while the dCSL model reaches
  equilibrium consistently only under certain dynamical conditions, thus allowing
  us to identify the values—in the parameter space—where the latter mechanism can
  be faithfully used to describe a thermodynamically consistent phenomenon.

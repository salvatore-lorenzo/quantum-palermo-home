abstract: 'A 3D advection-diffusion-reaction model is proposed to investigate the
  abundance of phytoplankton in a difficult-to-access ecosystem such as the Gulf of
  Sirte (southern Mediterranean Sea) characterized by oligotrophic waters. The model
  exploits experimentally measured environmental variables to reproduce the dynamics
  of four populations that dominate phytoplankton community in the studied area: Synechococcus,
  Prochlorococcus HL, Prochlorococcus LL and picoeukaryotes. The theoretical results
  obtained for phytoplankton abundances are converted into chl-a and Dvchl-a concentrations,
  and the simulated vertical chlorophyll profiles are compared to the corresponding
  experimentally acquired data during the MedSudMed-08 oceanographic survey. Non parametric
  tests showed that the 3D model successfully simulates the spatial distribution of
  chlorophyll in most of the Gulf of Sirte. Statistical analysis indicates that about
  80% of the simulated chlorophyll vertical profiles are not significantly different
  from the experimental data. This model is also a useful tool to predict chlorophyll
  distributions in hard-to-access areas, where experimental data cannot be collected.
  Moreover, the model could be used to predict the effects of global warming on phytoplankton
  dynamics and primary production in marine ecosystems. oÌ§pyright 2021 Elsevier B.V.'

abstract: 'We model and study the processes of excitation, absorption, and transfer
  in various networks. The model consists of a harmonic oscillator representing a
  single-mode radiation field, a qubit acting as an antenna, a network through which
  the excitation propagates, and a qubit at the end serving as a sink. We investigate
  how off-resonant excitations can be optimally absorbed and transmitted through the
  network. Three strategies are considered: optimising network energies, adjusting
  the couplings between the radiation field, the antenna, and the network, or introducing
  and optimising driving fields at the start and end of the network. These strategies
  are tested on three different types of network with increasing complexity: nearest-neighbour
  and star configurations, and one associated with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.
  The results show that, among the various strategies, the introduction of driving
  fields is the most effective, leading to a significant increase in the probability
  of reaching the sink in a given time. This result remains stable across networks
  of varying dimensionalities and types, and the driving process requires only a few
  parameters to be effective.'

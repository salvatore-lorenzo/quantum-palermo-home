abstract: We present a machine learning-based approach for characterising the environment
  that affects the dynamics of an open quantum system. We focus on the case of an
  exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment interaction, whose
  strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure dephasing. By using artificial
  neural networks trained on the Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables
  of the system, we perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic,
  and super-Ohmic spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters
  of the spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law.
  Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter estimation,
  highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for probing environmental
  features in quantum systems and advancing quantum noise spectroscopy.

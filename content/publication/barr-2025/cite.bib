 abstract = {Spectral densities encode essential information about system-environment interactions in open-quantum systems, 
playing a pivotal role in shaping the system’s dynamics. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key environmental features, 
going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the system’s dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping. 
For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, 
we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density 
as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.},

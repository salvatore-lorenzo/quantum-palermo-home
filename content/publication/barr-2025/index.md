abstract: Spectral densities encode essential information about system-environment
  interactions in open-quantum systems,  playing a pivotal role in shaping the system’s
  dynamics. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key
  environmental features,  going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the
  system’s dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping.  For a dissipative spin-boson
  model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks,  we
  demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural
  network to classify the spectral density  as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian
  peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.

 abstract = {Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterizing the system–environment interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such information is key to determining the system’s dynamics. In this work, we leverage the potential of machine learning techniques to reconstruct the features of the environment. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by an artificial neural network to infer the main features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant examples of spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter of the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby distinguishing between different forms of dissipation.},

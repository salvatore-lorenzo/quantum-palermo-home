abstract: Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterizing the system–environment
  interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such information is key to determining
  the system’s dynamics. In this work, we leverage the potential of machine learning
  techniques to reconstruct the features of the environment. Specifically, we show
  that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by an artificial neural
  network to infer the main features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant
  examples of spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter
  of the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby distinguishing
  between different forms of dissipation.

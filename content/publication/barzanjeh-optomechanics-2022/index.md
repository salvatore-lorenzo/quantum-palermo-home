abstract: The ability to control the motion of mechanical systems through its interaction
  with light has opened the door to a plethora of applications in fundamental and
  applied physics. With experiments routinely reaching the quantum regime, the focus
  has now turned towards creating and exploiting interesting non-classical states
  of motion and entanglement in optomechanical systems. Quantumness has also shifted
  from being the very reason why experiments are constructed to becoming a resource
  for the investigation of fundamental physics and the creation of quantum technologies.
  Here, by focusing on opto- and electromechanical platforms we review recent progress
  in quantum state preparation and entanglement of mechanical systems, together with
  applications to signal processing and transduction, quantum sensing, topological
  physics, as well as small-scale thermodynamics.

 abstract = {We study noise-induced transformations in the two-age structured population model with the Allee effect and environmental fluctuations. In this bistable model, ecological shifts are associated mathematically with random transitions between basins of coexisting attractors. The following phenomena are revealed and studied: (i) noise-induced extinction, (ii) stochastic regeneration, and (iii) excitement of random mixed-mode oscillations. Constructive abilities of the analytical method of confidence domains are demonstrated in the parametric study of these phenomena. oÌ§pyright 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

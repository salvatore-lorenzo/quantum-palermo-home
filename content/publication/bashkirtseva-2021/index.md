abstract: 'We study noise-induced transformations in the two-age structured population
  model with the Allee effect and environmental fluctuations. In this bistable model,
  ecological shifts are associated mathematically with random transitions between
  basins of coexisting attractors. The following phenomena are revealed and studied:
  (i) noise-induced extinction, (ii) stochastic regeneration, and (iii) excitement
  of random mixed-mode oscillations. Constructive abilities of the analytical method
  of confidence domains are demonstrated in the parametric study of these phenomena.

abstract: We put forth a unifying formalism for the description of the thermodynamics
  of continuously monitored systems, where measurements are only performed on the
  environment connected to a system. We show, in particular, that the conditional
  and unconditional entropy production, which quantify the degree of irreversibility
  of the open system's dynamics, are related to each other by the Holevo quantity.
  This, in turn, can be further split into an information gain rate and loss rate,
  which provide conditions for the existence of informational steady-states (ISSs),
  i.e. stationary states of a conditional dynamics that are maintained owing to the
  unbroken acquisition of information. We illustrate the applicability of our framework
  through several examples.

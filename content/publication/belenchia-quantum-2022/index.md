abstract: 'Advances in quantum technologies are giving rise to a revolution in the
  way fundamental physics questions are explored at the empirical level. At the same
  time, they are the seeds for future disruptive technological applications of quantum
  physics. Remarkably, a space-based environment may open many new avenues for exploring
  and employing quantum physics and technologies. Recently, space missions employing
  quantum technologies for fundamental or applied studies have been proposed and implemented
  with stunning results. The combination of quantum physics and its space application
  is the focus of this review: we cover both the fundamental scientific questions
  that can be tackled with quantum technologies in space and the possible implementation
  of these technologies for a variety of academic and commercial purposes.'

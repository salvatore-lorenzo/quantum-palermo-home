abstract: We analyze the stability of four-dimensional de Sitter vacua constructed
  by compactifying massive Type IIA supergravity in the presence of two O8 sources
  [1]. When embedded in String Theory the first source has a clear interpretation
  as an O8- plane, but the second one could correspond to either an O8+ plane or to
  an O8- plane with 16 D8-branes on top. We find that this latter solution has a tachyonic
  instability, corresponding to the D8 branes moving away from the O8- plane. We comment
  on the possible ways of distinguishing between these sources.

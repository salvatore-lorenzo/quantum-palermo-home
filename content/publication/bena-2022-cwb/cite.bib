 abstract = {We compute the supersymmetry-breaking three-form fluxes generated by the addition of anti-D3 branes at the tip of a Klebanov-Strassler throat. These fluxes give rise to nontrivial terms in the superpotential when the throat is embedded in a flux compactification. We describe these terms both from a ten-dimensional and from a four-dimensional perspective and show that, upon including Kähler-moduli stabilization, the resulting potential admits de Sitter minima. Our proposed de Sitter construction does not require additional supersymmetry-breaking (0,3) fluxes, and hence is more minimalist than the KKLT proposal.},

abstract: Anti-D3 branes at the bottom of warped throats, commonly used to uplift
  the cosmological constant in String-Theory de Sitter proposals, source a plethora
  of supersymmetry-breaking fluxes, that can interact nontrivially with other ingredients
  of the flux compactification. In this paper we perform a complex-structure decomposition
  of these fluxes, and compute the effect of the (0,3) flux component on the stabilization
  of Kähler moduli via D7-branes gaugino condensation. This allows us to obtain a
  new constraint on the validity of this stabilization mechanism. This effect does
  not appear hard to satisfy in de Sitter construction proposals that use long warped
  throats, but may be problematic in proposals where the warping is small.

abstract: We compute the supersymmetry-breaking three-form fluxes generated by the
  addition of anti-D3 branes at the tip of a Klebanov-Strassler throat. These fluxes
  give rise to nontrivial terms in the superpotential when the throat is embedded
  in a flux compactification. We describe these terms both from a ten-dimensional
  and from a four-dimensional perspective and show that, upon including Kähler-moduli
  stabilization, the resulting potential admits de Sitter minima. Our proposed de
  Sitter construction does not require additional supersymmetry-breaking (0,3) fluxes,
  and hence is more minimalist than the KKLT proposal.

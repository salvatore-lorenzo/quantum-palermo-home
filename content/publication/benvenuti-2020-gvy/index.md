abstract: "We consider 3d $$ mathcalN $$= 2 gauge theories with fundamental matter
  plus a single field in a rank-2 representation. Using iteratively a process of ``deconfinement''
  of the rank-2 field, we produce a sequence of Seiberg-dual quiver theories. We detail
  this process in two examples with zero superpotential: Usp(2N) gauge theory with
  an antisymmetric field and U(N) gauge theory with an adjoint field. The fully deconfined
  dual quiver has N nodes, and can be interpreted as an Aharony dual of theories with
  rank-2 matter. All chiral ring generators of the original theory are mapped into
  gauge singlet fields of the fully deconfined quiver dual."

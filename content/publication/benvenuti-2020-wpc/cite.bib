 abstract = {Seiberg-like dualities in 2 + 1d quiver gauge theories with 4 supercharges are investigated. We consider quivers made of various combinations of classical gauge groups U(N), Sp(N), SO(N) and SU(N). Our main focus is the mapping of the supersymmetric monopole operators across the dual theories. There is a simple general rule that encodes the mapping of the monopoles upon dualizing a single node. This rule dictates the mapping of all the monopoles which are not dressed by baryonic operators. We also study more general situations involving baryons and baryon-monopoles, focussing on three examples: SU − Sp, SO − SO and SO − Sp quivers.},

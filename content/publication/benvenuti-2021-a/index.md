abstract: 'Seiberg-like dualities in 2 + 1d quiver gauge theories with 4 supercharges
  are investigated. We consider quivers made of various combinations of classical
  gauge groups U(N), Sp(N), SO(N) and SU(N). Our main focus is the mapping of the
  supersymmetric monopole operators across the dual theories. There is a simple general
  rule that encodes the mapping of the monopoles upon dualizing a single node. This
  rule dictates the mapping of all the monopoles which are not dressed by baryonic
  operators. We also study more general situations involving baryons and baryon-monopoles,
  focussing on three examples: SU - Sp, SO - SO and SO - Sp quivers.'

 abstract = {We propose new confining dualities in 3d \$\$ \\mathcal\N\ \$\$= 2 gauge theories with orthogonal gauge groups, with and without monopole superpotentials. Deriving some of those dualities requires a sequence of gauging and Higgsing for a â„¤2 symmetry. This prevents the gauge theory from developing a smooth quantum moduli space and affects the global structure of the gauge group, muting it from SO to O+.},

abstract: We propose new confining dualities in 3d $$ mathcalN $$= 2 gauge theories
  with orthogonal gauge groups, with and without monopole superpotentials. Deriving
  some of those dualities requires a sequence of gauging and Higgsing for a â„¤2 symmetry.
  This prevents the gauge theory from developing a smooth quantum moduli space and
  affects the global structure of the gauge group, muting it from SO to O+.

abstract: The formalism of linear response theory can be extended to encompass physical
  situations where an open quantum system evolves towards a non-equilibrium steady-state.
  Here, we use the framework put forward by Konopik and Lutz [Phys. Rev. Research
  textbf1, 033156 (2019)] to go beyond unitary perturbations of the dynamics. Considering
  an open system comprised of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we study the
  system's response to unitary perturbations, affecting the Hamiltonian dynamics,
  as well as non-unitary perturbations, affecting the properties of the environment,
  e.g., its temperature and squeezing. We show that linear response, combined with
  a quantum probing approach, can effectively provide valuable quantitative information
  about the perturbation and characteristics of the environment, even in cases of
  non-unitary dynamics.

abstract: A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described
  by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This
  problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need
  fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in
  character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it
  alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether
  gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment
  to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two
  micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions
  of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals
  could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently
  be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based
  on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum
  technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with
  excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise.
  In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While
  implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions
  that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.

abstract: Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible
  scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators
  identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes. In this work, we shift
  the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate
  transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact
  diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains,
  we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially
  with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values
  far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy
  between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior,
  which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables
  in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not
  fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity
  of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size
  studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and
  underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian
  settings.

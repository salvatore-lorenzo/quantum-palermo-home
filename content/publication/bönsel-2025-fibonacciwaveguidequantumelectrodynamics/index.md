abstract: 'Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for
  engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays
  with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally
  different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths
  are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution
  rule. These \"Fibonacci waveguides\" lack translational invariance and are characterized
  by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing
  a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate
  how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We
  analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest
  aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound
  states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic
  sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the
  Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the
  aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating
  bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective
  Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides
  as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the
  deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into
  the interactions between quantum emitters.'

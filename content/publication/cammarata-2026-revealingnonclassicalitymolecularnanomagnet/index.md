abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are compounds characterized by a high-spin magnetic
  core that is protected by organic ligands. They have recently gained attention as
  potential quantum information carriers in solid-state quantum computing platforms,
  simultaneously exhibiting classical macroscopic properties and quantum features
  in light of their complex nature and configuration. Addressing the condition when
  they manifest unquestionable quantum behavior is key to guarantee their effectiveness
  as resources for quantum information processing. We address the quantumness of molecular
  nanomagnets using a recently formulated criterion [cf. Krisnanda et al., Phys. Rev.
  Lett. 119, 120402 (2017)] demonstrating that these systems exhibit an intrinsic
  quantum nature, as evidenced by their ability to generate and enhance quantum correlations
  between two non-interacting probes. Our analysis, which is performed addressing
  various dynamical regimes, paves the way to the design of experimentally viable
  tests of non-classicality in multipartite registers consisting of ensembles of molecular
  nanomagnets.

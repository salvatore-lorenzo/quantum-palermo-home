abstract: The recently proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) source of entangled
  photons enables higher efficiency in entanglement distribution than SPDC sources
  and can be carried out using both space-to-ground and ground-to-ground links. We
  demonstrate the flexibility of ZALM architectures to be adapted to alternative entanglement
  distribution protocols. Focusing on the counter-intuitive result that entanglement
  can be generated between distant parties without using any entanglement as a resource,
  we analyze two protocols for entanglement distribution to memories via separable
  states. Modelling them in a ZALM setup, we consider the effects of noise both in
  the communication channels and in the memories. We thereby identify the optimal
  protocol to use, with respect to the highest entanglement generated, given the noise
  conditions of the network.

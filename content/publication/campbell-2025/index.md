abstract: The characterisation of quantum networks is fundamental to understanding
  how energy and information propagates through complex systems, with applications
  in control, communication, error mitigation and energy transfer. In this work, we
  explore the use of external probes to infer the network topology in the context
  of continuous-time quantum walks, where a single excitation traverses the network
  with a pattern strongly influenced by its topology. The probes act as decay channels
  for the excitation, and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement
  on the network dynamics. By making use of a Genetic Optimisation algorithm, we demonstrate
  that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the
  topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited
  only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that
  increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task,
  revealing a tradeoff between the number of probes and the required computational
  power.

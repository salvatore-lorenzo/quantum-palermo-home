abstract: Summary We argue that, in the quest for the translation of fundamental research
  into actual quantum technologies, two avenues that have -- so far -- only partly
  explored should be pursued vigorously. On first entails that the study of energetics
  at the fundamental quantum level holds the promises for the design of a generation
  of more energy-efficient quantum devices. On second route to pursue implies a more
  structural hybridization of quantum dynamics with data science techniques and tools,
  for a more powerful framework for quantum information processing.

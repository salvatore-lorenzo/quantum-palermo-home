 abstract = {We argue that, in the quest for the translation of fundamental research into actual quantum technologies, two avenues that have - so far - only partly explored should be pursued vigorously. On first entails that the study of energetics at the fundamental quantum level holds the promises for the design of a generation of more energy-efficient quantum devices. On second route to pursue implies a more structural hybridisation of quantum dynamics with data science techniques and tools, for a more powerful framework for quantum information processing.},

abstract: We argue that, in the quest for the translation of fundamental research
  into actual quantum technologies, two avenues that have - so far - only partly explored
  should be pursued vigorously. On first entails that the study of energetics at the
  fundamental quantum level holds the promises for the design of a generation of more
  energy-efficient quantum devices. On second route to pursue implies a more structural
  hybridisation of quantum dynamics with data science techniques and tools, for a
  more powerful framework for quantum information processing.

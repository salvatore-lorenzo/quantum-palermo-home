abstract: The superposition principle is the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, leading
  to a variety of genuinely quantum effects. Whether the principle applies also to
  macroscopic systems or, instead, there is a progressive breakdown when moving to
  larger scales, is a fundamental and still open question. Spontaneous wavefunction
  collapse models predict the latter option, thus questioning the universality of
  quantum mechanics. Technological advances allow to challenge collapse models and
  the quantum superposition principle more and more with a variety of different experiments.
  Among them, non-interferometric experiments proved to be the most effective in testing
  these models. We provide an overview of such experiments, including cold atoms,
  optomechanical systems, X-rays detection, bulk heating as well as comparisons with
  cosmological observations. We also discuss avenues for future dedicated experiments,
  which aim at further testing collapse models and the validity of quantum mechanics.

abstract: 'Giant atoms are a new paradigm of quantum optics going beyond the usual
  local coupling. Building on this, a new type of decoherence-free (DF) many-body
  Hamiltonians was shown in a broadband waveguide. Here these are incorporated in
  a general framework (not relying on master equations) and contrasted to dispersive
  DF Hamiltonians with normal atoms: the two schemes are shown to correspond to qualitatively
  different ways to match the same general condition for suppressing decoherence.
  Next, we map the giant atoms dynamics into a cascaded collision model (CM), providing
  an intuitive interpretation of the connection between nontrivial DF Hamiltonians
  and coupling points topology. The braided configuration is shown to implement a
  scheme where a shuttling system subject to periodic phase kicks mediates a DF coupling
  between the atoms. From the viewpoint of CMs theory, this shows a collision model
  where ancillas effectively implement a dissipationless, maximally entangling two-qubit
  gate on the system.'

abstract: 'In this article we provide a review of geometrical methods employed in
  the analysis of quantum phase transitions and non-equilibrium dissipative phase
  transitions. After a pedagogical introduction to geometric phases and geometric
  information in the characterisation of quantum phase transitions, we describe recent
  developments of geometrical approaches based on mixed-state generalisation of the
  Berry-phase, i.e. the Uhlmann geometric phase, for the investigation of non-equilibrium
  steady-state quantum phase transitions (NESS-QPTs ). Equilibrium phase transitions
  fall invariably into two markedly non-overlapping categories: classical phase transitions
  and quantum phase transitions, whereas in NESS-QPTs this distinction may fade off.
  The approach described in this review, among other things, can quantitatively assess
  the quantum character of such critical phenomena. This framework is applied to a
  paradigmatic class of lattice Fermion systems with local reservoirs, characterised
  by Gaussian non-equilibrium steady states. The relations between the behaviour of
  the geometric phase curvature, the divergence of the correlation length, the character
  of the criticality and the gap -- either Hamiltonian or dissipative -- are reviewed.'

abstract: Abstract Floquet engineering consists in the modification of physical systems
  by the application of periodic time-dependent perturbations. The search for the
  shape of the periodic perturbation that best modifies the properties of a system
  in order to achieve some predefined metastable target behavior can be formulated
  as an optimal control problem. We discuss several ways to formulate and solve this
  problem. We present, as examples, some applications in the context of material science,
  although the methods discussed here are valid for any quantum system (from molecules
  and nanostructures to extended periodic and non periodic quantum materials). In
  particular, we show how one can achieve the manipulation of the Floquet pseudo-bandstructure
  of a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer (MoS 2 ).

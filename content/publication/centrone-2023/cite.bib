 abstract = {We present a scheme for the charging of a quantum battery based on the dynamics of an open quantum system undergoing coherent quantum squeezing and affected by an incoherent squeezed thermal bath. We show that quantum coherence, as instigated by the application of coherent squeezing, are key in the determination of the performance of the charging process, which is efficiency-enhanced at low environmental temperature and under a strong squeezed driving.},

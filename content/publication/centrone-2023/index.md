abstract: We present a scheme for the charging of a quantum battery based on the dynamics
  of an open quantum system undergoing coherent quantum squeezing and affected by
  an incoherent squeezed thermal bath. We show that quantum coherence, as instigated
  by the application of coherent squeezing, are key in the determination of the performance
  of the charging process, which is efficiency-enhanced at low environmental temperature
  and under a strong squeezed driving.

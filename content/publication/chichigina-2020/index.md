abstract: In this paper we present a study on pulse noise sources characterized by
  sub- and super-Poisson statistics. We make a comparison with their uncorrelated
  counterpart. i.e. pulse noise with Poisson statistics, while showing that the correlation
  properties of sub- and super-Poisson noise sources can be efficiently applied to
  population dynamics. Specifically, we consider a termite population, described by
  a Langevin equation in the presence of a pulse noise source, and we study its dynamics
  and stability properties for two models. The first one describes a population of
  several colonies in a new territory with adverse environmental conditions. The second
  one considers the development of a single colony under the influence of attacks
  by predators. oÌ§pyright 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl

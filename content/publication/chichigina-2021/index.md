abstract: In this paper we present a study on random processes consisting of delta
  pulses characterized by strongly super-Poisson statistics and calculate its spectral
  density. We suggest a method for replacing a strongly super-Poisson process with
  a wide-pulse Poisson process, while demonstrating that these two processes can be
  set in such a way to have similar spectral densities, the same mean values, and
  the same correlation times. We also present a billiard system that can be used to
  generate random pulse noise of arbitrary statistical properties. The particle dynamics
  is considered in terms of delta and wide pulses simultaneously. The results of numerical
  experiments with the billiard system are in a good agreement with the analytical
  findings. oÌ§pyright 2021 Elsevier Ltd

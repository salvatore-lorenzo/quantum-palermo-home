 abstract = {Understanding the emergence of objectivity from the quantum realm has been a long standing issue strongly related to the quantum to classical crossover. Quantum Darwinism (QD) provides an answer, interpreting objectivity as consensus between independent observers. Quantum computers provide an interesting platform for such experimental investigation of QD, fulfiling their initial intended purpose as quantum simulators. Here we assess to what degree current Noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices can be used as experimental platforms in the field of QD. We do this by simulating an exactly solvable stochastic collision model, taking advantage of the analytical solution to benchmark the experimental results.},

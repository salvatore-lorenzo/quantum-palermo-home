abstract: Understanding the emergence of objectivity from the quantum realm has been
  a long standing issue strongly related to the quantum to classical crossover. Quantum
  Darwinism (QD) provides an answer, interpreting objectivity as consensus between
  independent observers. Quantum computers provide an interesting platform for such
  experimental investigation of QD, fulfiling their initial intended purpose as quantum
  simulators. Here we assess to what degree current Noisy intermediate-scale quantum
  devices can be used as experimental platforms in the field of QD. We do this by
  simulating an exactly solvable stochastic collision model, taking advantage of the
  analytical solution to benchmark the experimental results.

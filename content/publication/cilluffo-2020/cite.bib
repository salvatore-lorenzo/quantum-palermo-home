 abstract = {Nonclassical correlations in quantum optics as resources for quantum computation are important in the quest for highly specialized quantum devices. Here, we put forward a methodology to witness nonclassicality of the output field from a generic quantum optical setup via the statistics of time-integrated photocurrents. Specifically, exploiting the thermodynamics of quantum trajectories, we express a known nonclassicality witness for bosonic fields fully in terms of the source master equation, thus bypassing the explicit calculation of the output light state.},

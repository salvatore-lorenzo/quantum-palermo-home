abstract: Nonclassical correlations in quantum optics as resources for quantum computation
  are important in the quest for highly specialized quantum devices. Here, we put
  forward a methodology to witness nonclassicality of the output field from a generic
  quantum optical setup via the statistics of time-integrated photocurrents. Specifically,
  exploiting the thermodynamics of quantum trajectories, we express a known nonclassicality
  witness for bosonic fields fully in terms of the source master equation, thus bypassing
  the explicit calculation of the output light state.

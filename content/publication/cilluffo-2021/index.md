abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for biasing the quantum trajectories of
  an open quantum system, which renders rare trajectories typical. To this end we
  consider a discrete-time quantum dynamics, where the open system collides sequentially
  with qubit probes which are then measured. A theoretical framework is built in terms
  of thermodynamic functionals in order to characterize its quantum trajectories (each
  embodied by a sequence of measurement outcomes). We show that the desired biasing
  is achieved by suitably modifying the Kraus operators describing the discrete open
  system dynamics. From a microscopical viewpoint and for short collision times, this
  corresponds to adding extra collisions which enforce the system to follow a desired
  rare trajectory. The above extends the theory of biased quantum trajectories from
  Lindblad-like dynamics to sequences of arbitrary dynamical maps, providing at once
  a transparent physical interpretation.

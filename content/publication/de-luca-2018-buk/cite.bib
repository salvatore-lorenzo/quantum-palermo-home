 abstract = {The geometry of the $\mathcalN=3$, SO(4)-invariant, AdS4 solution of massive type IIA supergravity that uplifts from the $\mathcalN=3$ vacuum of D=4 $\mathcalN=8$ dyonic ISO(7) supergravity is investigated. Firstly, a D=4, SO(4)-invariant restricted duality hierarchy is constructed and used to uplift the entire, dynamical SO(4)-invariant sector to massive type IIA. The resulting consistent uplift formulae are used to obtain a new local expression for the $\mathcalN=3$ AdS4 solution in massive IIA and analyse its geometry. Locally, the internal S6 geometry corresponds to a warped fibration of S2 and a hemisphere of S4. This can be regarded as a warped generalisation of the usual twistor fibration geometry. Finally, the triplet of Killing spinors corresponding to the $\mathcalN=3$ solution are constructed and shown to obey the massive type IIA Killing spinor equations.},

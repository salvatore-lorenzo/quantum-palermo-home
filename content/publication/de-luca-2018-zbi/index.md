abstract: A notable class of superconformal theories (SCFTs) in six dimensions is
  parameterized by an integer N , an ADE group G, and two nilpotent elements Î¼L,R
  in G. Nilpotent elements have a natural partial ordering, which has been conjectured
  to coincide with the hierarchy of renormalization-group flows among the SCFTs. In
  this paper we test this conjecture for G = SU(k), where AdS7 duals exist in IIA.
  We work with a seven-dimensional gauged supergravity, consisting of the gravity
  multiplet and two SU(k) non-Abelian vector multiplets. We show that this theory
  has many supersymmetric AdS7 vacua, determined by two nilpotent elements, which
  are naturally interpreted as IIA AdS7 solutions. The BPS equations for domain walls
  connecting two such vacua can be solved analytically, up to a Nahm equation with
  certain boundary conditions. The latter admit a solution connecting two vacua if
  and only if the corresponding nilpotent elements are related by the natural partial
  ordering, in agreement with the field theory conjecture.

 abstract = {The emergence of traveling sine-Gordon breathers due to the nonlinear supratransmission effect is theoretically studied in a long Josephson junction driven by suitable magnetic pulses, taking into account the presence of dissipation, a current bias, and a thermal noise source. The simulations clearly indicate that, depending on the pulse's shape and the values of the main system parameters, such a configuration can effectively yield breather excitations only. Furthermore, a nonmonotonic behavior of the breather-only generation probability is observed as a function of the noise intensity. Finally, the dynamics of the supratransmission-induced breathers is characterized by looking at quantities such as their radiative decay lifetime and the medium's energy.},

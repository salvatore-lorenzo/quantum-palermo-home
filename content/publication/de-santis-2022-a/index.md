abstract: The emergence of traveling sine-Gordon breathers due to the nonlinear supratransmission
  effect is theoretically studied in a long Josephson junction driven by suitable
  magnetic pulses, taking into account the presence of dissipation, a current bias,
  and a thermal noise source. The simulations clearly indicate that, depending on
  the pulse's shape and the values of the main system parameters, such a configuration
  can effectively yield breather excitations only. Furthermore, a nonmonotonic behavior
  of the breather-only generation probability is observed as a function of the noise
  intensity. Finally, the dynamics of the supratransmission-induced breathers is characterized
  by looking at quantities such as their radiative decay lifetime and the medium's
  energy.

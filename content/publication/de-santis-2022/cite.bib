 abstract = {A scheme for the controlled generation of single traveling sine-Gordon breathers in a long Josephson junction is described. In the presence of dissipation, a direct current source, and thermal fluctuations, the theoretical analysis shows that, through the nonlinear supratransmission effect, tailored magnetic pulses at the junction's edge can effectively yield breather modes only.},

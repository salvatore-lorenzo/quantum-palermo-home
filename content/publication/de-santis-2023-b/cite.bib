 abstract = {A sine-Gordon breather enhances the heat transfer in a thermally biased long Josephson junction. This solitonic channel allows for the tailoring of the local temperature throughout the system. Furthermore, the phenomenon implies a clear thermal fingerprint for the breather, and thus a 'non-destructive' breather detection strategy is proposed here. Distinct breathing frequencies result in morphologically different local temperature peaks, which can be identified in an experiment.},

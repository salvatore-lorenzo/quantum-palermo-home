 abstract = {Summary. — A noise-induced enhancement of the breather stability in a lossy, stochastic sine-Gordon system is discussed. The numerical solutions indicate that a spatially uniform noisy source enables a stationary breather to survive way beyond its deterministic lifetime. An average characteristic time for the breather is defined, whose values vary nonmonotonically as a function of the noise strength, while being almost unaffected by the mode’s initial phase. © 2023 Societa Italiana di Fisica.

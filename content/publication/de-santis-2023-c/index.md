abstract: Summary. — A noise-induced enhancement of the breather stability in a lossy,
  stochastic sine-Gordon system is discussed. The numerical solutions indicate that
  a spatially uniform noisy source enables a stationary breather to survive way beyond
  its deterministic lifetime. An average characteristic time for the breather is defined,
  whose values vary nonmonotonically as a function of the noise strength, while being
  almost unaffected by the mode’s initial phase. © 2023 Societa Italiana di Fisica.

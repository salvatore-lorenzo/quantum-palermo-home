 abstract = {A complete framework for exciting and detecting thermally-induced, stabilized sine-Gordon breathers in ac-driven annular long Josephson junctions is developed. The formation of long-time stable breathers locked to the ac source occurs for a sufficiently high temperature. The latter emerges as a powerful control parameter, allowing for the remarkably stable localized modes to appear. Nonmonotonic behaviors of both the breather generation probability and the energy spatial correlations versus the thermal noise strength are found. The junction's resistive switching characteristics provides a clear experimental signature of the breather. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

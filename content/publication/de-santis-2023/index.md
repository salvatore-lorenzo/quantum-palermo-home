abstract: The dynamics of sine-Gordon breathers is studied in the presence of dissipative
  and stochastic perturbations. Taking a stationary breather with a random phase value
  as the initial state, the simulations demonstrate that a spatially-homogeneous noisy
  source can make the oscillatory excitation more stable, i.e., it enables the latter
  to last significantly longer than it would in a noise-free scenario. Both the frequency
  domain and the localization of energy are examined to illustrate the effectiveness
  of the noise-enhanced stability phenomenon, which manifests itself as a nonmonotonic
  behavior of the mean first-passage time for the breather as a function of the noise
  intensity. The influence of the mode's initial frequency on the results and their
  robustness against an additional thermal background are also addressed. Overall,
  the analysis highlights a counter-intuitive, positive role of noise in the breather's
  persistence.

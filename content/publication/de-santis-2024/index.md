abstract: Noisy and ac forcing can cooperatively lead to the emergence of sine-Gordon
  breathers robust to dissipation. This phenomenon is studied, for both Neumann and
  periodic boundary conditions, at different values of the main system parameters,
  such as the noise intensity and the ac frequency-amplitude pair. In all the considered
  cases, nonmonotonicities of the probability of generating only breathers versus
  the noise strength are observed, implying that optimal noise ranges for the breather
  formation process exist. Within the latter scenarios, the statistics of the breathers’
  number, position, and amplitude are analyzed. The number of breathers is found to
  grow, on average, with the noise amplitude. The breathers’ spatial distribution
  is sharply peaked at the system's edges for Neumann boundary conditions, whereas
  it is essentially uniform for periodic boundary conditions. The average breather
  amplitude is dictated by the ac frequency-amplitude pair. Finally, a size analysis
  shows that the minimum system length for the generation mechanism is given by the
  typical breather half-width (width) in the case of Neumann boundary conditions (periodic
  boundary conditions). © 2023 The Author(s)

 abstract = {The generation of travelling sine-Gordon breathers is achieved through the nonlinear supratransmission effect in a magnetically driven long Josephson junction, in the presence of losses, a current bias, and a thermal noise source. We demonstrate how to exclusively induce breather modes by means of controlled magnetic pulses. A nonmonotonic behavior of the breather-only generation probability is observed as a function of the noise intensity. An experimental protocol providing evidence of the Josephson breather's existence is proposed.},

abstract: The generation of travelling sine-Gordon breathers is achieved through the
  nonlinear supratransmission effect in a magnetically driven long Josephson junction,
  in the presence of losses, a current bias, and a thermal noise source. We demonstrate
  how to exclusively induce breather modes by means of controlled magnetic pulses.
  A nonmonotonic behavior of the breather-only generation probability is observed
  as a function of the noise intensity. An experimental protocol providing evidence
  of the Josephson breather's existence is proposed.

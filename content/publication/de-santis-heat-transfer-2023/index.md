abstract: A sine-Gordon breather enhances the heat transfer in a thermally biased
  long Josephson junction. This solitonic channel allows for the tailoring of the
  local temperature throughout the system. Furthermore, the phenomenon implies a clear
  thermal fingerprint for the breather, and thus a 'non-destructive' breather detection
  strategy is proposed here. Distinct breathing frequencies result in morphologically
  different local temperature peaks, which can be identified in an experiment.

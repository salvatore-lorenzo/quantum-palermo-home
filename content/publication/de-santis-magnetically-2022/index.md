abstract: A scheme for the controlled generation of single traveling sine-Gordon breathers
  in a long Josephson junction is described. In the presence of dissipation, a direct
  current source, and thermal fluctuations, the theoretical analysis shows that, through
  the nonlinear supratransmission effect, tailored magnetic pulses at the junction's
  edge can effectively yield breather modes only.

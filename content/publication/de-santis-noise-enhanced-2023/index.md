abstract: A noise-induced enhancement of the breather stability in a lossy, stochastic
  sine-Gordon system is discussed. The numerical solutions indicate that a spatially
  uniform noisy source enables a stationary breather to survive way beyond its deterministic
  lifetime. An average characteristic time for the breather is defined, whose values
  vary nonmonotonically as a function of the noise strength, while being almost unaffected
  by the mode's initial phase.

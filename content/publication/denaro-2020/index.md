abstract: The biogeochemical dynamics of Hg, and specifically of its three species
  Hg0, HgII, and MeHg (elemental, inorganic, and organic, respectively), in the marine
  coastal area of Augusta Bay (southern Italy) have been explored by the high-resolution
  3D Hg (HR3DHG) model, namely an advection diffusion reaction model for dissolved
  mercury in the seawater compartment coupled with a diffusion reaction model for
  dissolved mercury in the pore water of sediments in which the desorption process
  for the sediment total mercury is taken into account. The spatiotemporal variability
  of the mercury concentration in both seawater ([HgD]) and the first layers of bottom
  sediments ([HgsedD] and [HgsedT]), as well as the Hg fluxes at the boundaries of
  the 3D model domain, have been theoretically reproduced, showing acceptable agreement
  with the experimental data collected in multiple field observations during six different
  oceanographic cruises. Also, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the total mercury concentration
  in seawater have been obtained by using both model results and field observations.
  The mass balance of the total Hg species in seawater has been calculated for the
  Augusta Harbour, improving previous estimations. The HR3DHG model could be used
  as an effective tool to predict the spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved and
  total mercury concentrations, while contributing to better assessing hazards for
  the environment and therefore for human health in highly polluted areas. oÌ§pyright

abstract: Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum
  many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely limited
  by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum resolution.
  We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial resolution of
  ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities of two-dimensional
  spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze momentum-resolved 2DS
  of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low energy dynamics of two weakly
  coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. This approach reveals distinctive
  many-body signatures, most notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay
  between isolated (B2 breather) and continuum (B1 pair) modes. The protocol further
  enables direct characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved
  2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe of
  correlated quantum matter.

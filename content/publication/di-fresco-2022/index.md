abstract: Single parameter estimation is known to benefit from extreme sensitivity
  to parameter changes in quantum critical systems. However, the simultaneous estimation
  of multiple parameters is generally limited due to the incompatibility arising from
  the quantum nature of the underlying system. A key question is whether quantum criticality
  may also play a positive role in reducing the incompatibility in the simultaneous
  estimation of multiple parameters. We argue that this is generally the case and
  verify this prediction in paradigmatic quantum many-body systems close to first
  and second order phase transitions. The antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic 1-D
  Ising chain with both transverse and longitudinal fields are analysed across different
  regimes and close to criticality.

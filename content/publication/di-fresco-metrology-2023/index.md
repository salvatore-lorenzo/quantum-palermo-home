abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition arises from the competition between
  a deterministic quantum evolution and a repeated measurement process. We explore
  the measurement-induced phase transition through the Quantum Fisher Information
  in two different metrological scenarios. We demonstrate through the scaling behavior
  of the quantum Fisher information the transition of the multi-partite entanglement
  across the phases. In analogy with standard quantum phase transition, we reveal
  signature of a measurement-induced phase transition in the non-analytic behaviour
  of the quantum Fisher information as the measurement strength approaches the critical
  value. Our results offer novel insights into the features of a quantum systems undergoing
  measurement-induced phase transition and indicate potential avenues for further
  exploration in the field of quantum physics.

abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic
  systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned
  with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called  compact localized states
  (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole
  interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a
  FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that
  the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance
  with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with
  standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the
  FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between
  CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large
  class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling)
  allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition
  of a few of these.

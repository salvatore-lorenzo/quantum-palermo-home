abstract: We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic
  lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes
  that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice
  (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes
  form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show
  that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity
  QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging
  as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and,
  most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit,
  yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that
  can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi
  oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental
  demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.

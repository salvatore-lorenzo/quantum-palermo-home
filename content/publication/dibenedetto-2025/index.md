abstract: Geometric effects in curvilinear nanomagnets can enable chiral, anisotropic,
  and even magnetoelectric responses. Here, we study the effects of magnetic frustration
  in curvilinear (quasi-)one-dimensional magnets represented by spin chains arranged
  along closed space curves of constant torsion. Considering the cases of easy- and
  hard-axis anisotropy in ferro- and antiferromagnetic samples, we determine their
  ground states and analyze the related magnetoelectric multipoles. A constant torsion
  along the chain results in alternating regions of high and low curvature, facilitating
  the spin spiral state perturbed by the (anti)periodic boundary conditions on the
  magnetic order parameter. While easy-axis ferromagnetic chains develop a purely
  toroidal configuration with the magnetic toroidal moment oriented along the geometry
  symmetry axis, hard-axis antiferromagnetic chains support multiple magnetic toroidal
  domains. Our findings suggest that tailoring curvature and torsion of a spin chain
  enables a different physical mechanism for magnetic frustration, which can be observed
  in the inhomogeneity of the magnetic order parameter and in the local ferrotoroidal
  responses.

abstract: Among the possible superalgebras that contain the AdS3 isometries, two interesting
  possibilities are the exceptional F(4) and G(3). Their R-symmetry is respectively
  SO(7) and G2, and the amount of supersymmetry and . We find that there exist two
  (locally) unique solutions in type IIA supergravity that realize these superalgebras,
  and we provide their analytic expressions. In both cases, the internal space is
  obtained by a round six-sphere fibred over an interval, with an O8-plane at one
  end. The R-symmetry is the symmetry group of the sphere; in the G(3) case, it is
  broken to G2 by fluxes. We also find several numerical solutions with G2 flavor
  symmetry, with various localized sources, including O2-planes and O8-planes.

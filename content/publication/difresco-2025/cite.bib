 abstract = {We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.},

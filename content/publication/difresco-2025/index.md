abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density
  on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump
  trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary
  state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both
  the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to
  full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence
  of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian
  waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed
  by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of
  fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals
  is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites
  which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its
  associated area law.

abstract: We analyze the residence time problem for an arbitrary Markovian process
  describing nonlinear systems without a steady state. We obtain exact analytical
  results for the statistical characteristics of the residence time. For diffusion
  in a fully unstable potential profile in the presence of Lévy noise we get the conditional
  probability density of the particle position and the average residence time. The
  noise-enhanced stability phenomenon is observed in the system investigated. Results
  from numerical simulations are in very good agreement with analytical ones. o̧pyright

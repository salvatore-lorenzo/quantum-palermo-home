abstract: We introduce and validate a machine-learning assisted quantum sensing protocol
  to classify spatial and temporal correlations of classical noise affecting two ultrastrongly
  coupled qubits. We consider six distinct classes of Markovian and non-Markovian
  noise. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under
  three distinct driving conditions, the various forms of noise are discriminated
  by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. Our approach achieves ≳86% accuracy
  in classification providing a near-perfect discrimination between Markovian and
  non-Markovian noise. The method requires minimal experimental resources, relying
  on a simple driving scheme providing three inputs to a shallow neural network with
  no need of measuring time-series data or real-time monitoring. The machine-learning
  data analysis acquires information from non-idealities of the coherent protocol
  highlighting how combining these techniques may significantly improve the characterization
  of quantum-hardware.

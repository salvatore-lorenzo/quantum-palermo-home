abstract: We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify
  time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using
  two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according
  to their Markovianity and spatial correlations. Leveraging the sensitivity of a
  coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the
  various noises are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies.
  This approach reaches around 90% accuracy with a minimal experimental overhead

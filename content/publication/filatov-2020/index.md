abstract: We report on the results of the experimental investigations of the local
  resistive switching (RS) in the contact of a conductive atomic force microscope
  (CAFM) probe to a nanometer-thick yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) film on a conductive
  substrate under a Gaussian noise voltage applied between the probe and the substrate.
  The virtual memristor was found to switch randomly between the low resistance state
  and the high resistance state as a random telegraph signal (RTS). The potential
  profile of the virtual memristor calculated from its response to the Gaussian white
  noise shows two local minima, which is peculiar of a bistable nonlinear system.

 abstract = {The effects of temperature on the switching kinetics of an yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based memristor from a low-resistance state to a high-resistance state have been experimentally investigated. It was found that the memristor relaxation time depends on the temperature in a non-monotonous way, with a maximum observed at the temperature close to 55 Â°C. This nonmonotonic behavior is a signature of the noise-enhanced stability phenomenon observed in all physical and complex systems characterized by metastable states.},

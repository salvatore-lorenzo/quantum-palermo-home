abstract: The effects of temperature on the switching kinetics of an yttrium-stabilized
  zirconia-based memristor from a low-resistance state to a high-resistance state
  have been experimentally investigated. It was found that the memristor relaxation
  time depends on the temperature in a non-monotonous way, with a maximum observed
  at the temperature close to 55 Â°C. This nonmonotonic behavior is a signature of
  the noise-enhanced stability phenomenon observed in all physical and complex systems
  characterized by metastable states.

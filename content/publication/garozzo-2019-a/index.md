abstract: An S-fold has played an important role in constructing supersymmetric field
  theories with interesting features. It can be viewed as a type of AdS4 solutions
  of Type IIB string theory where the fields in overlapping patches are glued by elements
  of SL(2, $â„¤$). This paper examines three dimensional quiver theories that arise
  from brane configurations with an inclusion of the S-fold. An important feature
  of such a quiver is that it contains a link, which is the T (U(N)) theory, between
  two U(N) groups, along with bifundamental and fundamental hypermultiplets. We systematically
  study the moduli spaces of those quiver theories, including the cases in which the
  non-zero Chern-Simons levels are turned on. A number of such moduli spaces turns
  out to have a very rich structure and tells us about the brane dynamics in the presence
  of an S-fold.

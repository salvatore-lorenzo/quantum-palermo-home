 abstract = {Enhancement of global symmetry and supersymmetry in the infrared is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum field theory. We investigate such phenomena in a large class of three dimensional superconformal field theories, known as the S-fold SCFTs. Supersymmetric indices are computed for a number of theories containing small rank gauge groups. It is found that indices of several models exhibit enhancement of supersymmetry at the superconformal fixed point in the infrared. Dualities between S-fold theories that have different quiver descriptions are also analysed. We explore a new class of theories with a discrete global symmetry, whose gauge symmetry in the quiver has a different global structure from those that have been studied earlier.},

abstract: Enhancement of global symmetry and supersymmetry in the infrared is one
  of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum field theory. We investigate such phenomena
  in a large class of three dimensional superconformal field theories, known as the
  S-fold SCFTs. Supersymmetric indices are computed for a number of theories containing
  small rank gauge groups. It is found that indices of several models exhibit enhancement
  of supersymmetry at the superconformal fixed point in the infrared. Dualities between
  S-fold theories that have different quiver descriptions are also analysed. We explore
  a new class of theories with a discrete global symmetry, whose gauge symmetry in
  the quiver has a different global structure from those that have been studied earlier.

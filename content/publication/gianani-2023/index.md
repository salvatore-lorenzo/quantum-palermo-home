abstract: Abstract Quantum coherence is a central ingredient in quantum physics with
  several theoretical and technological ramifications. We consider a figure of merit
  encoding the information on how the coherence generated on average by a quantum
  gate is affected by unitary errors (coherent noise sources) in the form of rotation-angle
  and rotation-axis errors. We provide numerical evidences that such information is
  well captured by the statistics of local energy measurements on the output states
  of the gate. These findings are then corroborated by experimental data taken in
  a quantum optics setting.

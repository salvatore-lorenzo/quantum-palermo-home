abstract: Quantum Optimal Control is an established field of research which is necessary
  for the development of Quantum Technologies. In recent years, Machine Learning techniques
  have been proved useful to tackle a variety of quantum problems. In particular,
  Reinforcement Learning has been employed to address typical problems of control
  of quantum systems. In this tutorial we introduce the methods of Quantum Optimal
  Control and Reinforcement Learning by applying them to the problem of three-level
  population transfer. The jupyter notebooks to reproduce some of our results are
  open-sourced and available on github1.

abstract: First-principles methods for time-resolved angular resolved photoelectron
  spectroscopy play a pivotal role in providing interpretation and microscopic understanding
  of the complex experimental data and in exploring novel observables or observation
  conditions that may be achieved in future experiments. Here we describe an efficient,
  reliable and scalable first-principles method for tr-ARPES based on time-dependent
  density functional theory including propagation and surface effects usually discarded
  in the widely used many-body techniques based on computing the non-equilibrium spectral
  function and discuss its application to a variety of pump-probe conditions. We identify
  four conditions, depending on the length of the probe relative to the excitation
  in the materials on the one hand and on the overlap between pump and probe on the
  other hand. Within this paradigm different examples of observables of time-resolved
  ARPES are discussed in view of the newly developed and highly accurate time-resolved
  experimental spectroscopies.

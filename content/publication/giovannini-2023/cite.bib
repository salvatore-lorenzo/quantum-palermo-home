 abstract = {Imaging the microscopic world in real space and real time is a grand challenge of science. In the landscape of time-resolved imaging techniques, laser-induced electron diffraction (LIED) has recently shown to be a promising candidate to push the frontiers of ultrafast molecular imaging. In this work, we review the main achievements of LIED research in terms of experimental results and advanced modelling. We also envision interesting perspectives toward the future advancement of time-resolved LIED imaging.},

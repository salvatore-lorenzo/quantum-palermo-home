abstract: Imaging the microscopic world in real space and real time is a grand challenge
  of science. In the landscape of time-resolved imaging techniques, laser-induced
  electron diffraction (LIED) has recently shown to be a promising candidate to push
  the frontiers of ultrafast molecular imaging. In this work, we review the main achievements
  of LIED research in terms of experimental results and advanced modelling. We also
  envision interesting perspectives toward the future advancement of time-resolved
  LIED imaging.

 abstract = {A protocol for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in a system of (Formula presented.) coupled qubits is proposed. The Hamiltonian model assumes (Formula presented.) -wise interactions between the (Formula presented.) qubits and the presence of a controllable time-dependent field acting upon one spin only. The dynamical problem is exactly solved thanks to the symmetries of the Hamiltonian model. The possibility of generating GHZ states simulating our physical scenario under both adiabatic and non-adiabatic conditions is within the reach of the experimentalists. This aspect is discussed in detail. o̧pyright 2022 The Authors. Fortschritte der Physik published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

abstract: A protocol for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in a system
  of (Formula presented.) coupled qubits is proposed. The Hamiltonian model assumes
  (Formula presented.) -wise interactions between the (Formula presented.) qubits
  and the presence of a controllable time-dependent field acting upon one spin only.
  The dynamical problem is exactly solved thanks to the symmetries of the Hamiltonian
  model. The possibility of generating GHZ states simulating our physical scenario
  under both adiabatic and non-adiabatic conditions is within the reach of the experimentalists.
  This aspect is discussed in detail. o̧pyright 2022 The Authors. Fortschritte der

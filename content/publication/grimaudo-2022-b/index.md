abstract: We discuss the resonant activation phenomenon on a Josephson junction due
  to the coupling of the Josephson system with axions. We show how such an effect
  can be exploited for axion detection. A nonmonotonic behavior, with a minimum, of
  the mean switching time from the superconducting to the resistive state versus the
  ratio of the axion energy and the Josephson plasma energy is found. We demonstrate
  how variations in switching times make it possible to detect the presence of the
  axion field. An experimental protocol for observing axions through their coupling
  with a Josephson system is proposed. oÌ§pyright 2022 American Physical Society.

 abstract = {We consider spin-chain-star systems characterized by N-wise many-body interactions between the spins in each chain and the central one. We show that such systems can be exactly mapped into standard spin-star systems through unitary transformations. Such an approach allows the solution of the dynamic problem of an (Formula presented.) spin-chain-star model and transparently shows the emergence of quantum correlations in the system, based on the idea of entanglement between chains. o̧pyright 2022 The Authors.

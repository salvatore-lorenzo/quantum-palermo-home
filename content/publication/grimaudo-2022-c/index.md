abstract: We consider spin-chain-star systems characterized by N-wise many-body interactions
  between the spins in each chain and the central one. We show that such systems can
  be exactly mapped into standard spin-star systems through unitary transformations.
  Such an approach allows the solution of the dynamic problem of an (Formula presented.)
  spin-chain-star model and transparently shows the emergence of quantum correlations
  in the system, based on the idea of entanglement between chains. o̧pyright 2022

abstract: The analysis of experimental data of the solar irradiance, collected on
  the marine surface, clearly highlights the intrinsic stochasticity of such an environmental
  parameter. Given this result, effects of randomly fluctuating irradiance on the
  population dynamics of a marine ecosystem are studied on the basis of the stochastic
  0-dimensional biogeochemical flux model. The noisy fluctuations of the irradiance
  are formally described as a multiplicative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, that is a
  self-correlated Gaussian noise. Nonmonotonic behaviours of the variance of the marine
  populations' biomass are found with respect to the intensity and the autocorrelation
  time of the noise source, manifesting a noise-induced transition of the ecosystem
  to an out-of-equilibrium steady state. Moreover, evidence of noise-induced effects
  on the organic carbon cycling processes underlying the food web dynamics are highlighted.
  The reported results clearly show the profound impact the stochastic environmental
  variables can have on both the populations and the biogeochemistry at the basis
  of a marine trophic network. oÌ§pyright 2022, The Author(s).

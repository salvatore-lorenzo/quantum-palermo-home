abstract: The direct effect of an axion field on Josephson junctions is analyzed through
  the consequences on the effective potential barrier that prevents the junction from
  switching from the superconducting to the finite-voltage state. We describe a method
  to reliably compute the quasipotential with stochastic simulations, which allows
  for the spanning of the coupling parameter from weakly interacting axion to tight
  interactions. As a result, we obtain an axion field that induces a change in the
  potential barrier, therefore determining a significant detectable effect for such
  a kind of elusive particle. oÌ§pyright 2023 by the authors.

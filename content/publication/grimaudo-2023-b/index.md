abstract: A spin-boson-like model with two interacting qubits is analysed. The model
  turns out to be exactly solvable since it is characterized by the exchange symmetry
  between the two spins. The explicit expressions of eigenstates and eigenenergies
  make it possible to analytically unveil the occurrence of first-order quantum phase
  transitions. The latter are physically relevant since they are characterized by
  abrupt changes in the two-spin subsystem concurrence, in the net spin magnetization
  and in the mean photon number. oÌ§pyright 2023 by the authors.

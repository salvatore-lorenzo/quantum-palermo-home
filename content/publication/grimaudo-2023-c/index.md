abstract: The model of two coupled quantum pendula is studied and its suitability
  to describe Josephson junctions interacting with axions is analysed. It is shown
  that some physical features of one pendulum, not directly accessible, can be deduced
  by local measures on the other one, which is experimentally available. Such an effect
  can be exploited for the axion (the invisible pendulum) detection based on Josephson
  junctions (the accessible pendulum). The interaction between axion and Josephson
  junction can be enhanced at the resonance, if the axion and the junction frequencies
  match, and if the accessible system is prepared in the most convenient initial quantum
  state. oÌ§pyright 2023 Elsevier Ltd

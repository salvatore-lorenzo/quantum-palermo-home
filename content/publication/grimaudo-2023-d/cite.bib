 abstract = {The class of two-interacting-qubit spin--boson models with vanishing transverse fields on the spin-pair is studied. The model can be mapped exactly into two independent standard single-impurity spin--boson models where the role of the tunneling parameter is played by the spin--spin coupling. The dynamics of the magnetization are analyzed for different levels of (an)isotropy. The existence of a decoherence-free subspace, as well as of different classical regimes separated by a critical temperature, and symptoms of quantum (first-order and Kosterlitz--Thouless type) phase transitions in the Ohmic regime are brought to light. oÌ§pyright 2023 by the authors.},

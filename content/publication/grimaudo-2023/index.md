abstract: A two-interacting-qubit quantum Rabi-like model with vanishing transverse
  fields on the qubit pair is studied. Independently of the coupling regime, this
  model can be exactly and unitarily reduced to two independent single-spin quantum
  Rabi models, where the spin-spin coupling plays the role of the transverse field.
  This transformation and the analytical treatment of the single-spin quantum Rabi
  model provide the key to prove the integrability of our model. The existence of
  different first-order quantum phase transitions, characterized by discontinuous
  two-spin magnetization, mean photon number, and concurrence, is brought to light.

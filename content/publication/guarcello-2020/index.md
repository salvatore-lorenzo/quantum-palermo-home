abstract: We propose to characterize Lévy-distributed stochastic fluctuations through
  the measurement of the average voltage drop across a current-biased Josephson junction.
  We show that the noise induced switching process in the Josephson washboard potential
  can be exploited to reveal and characterize Lévy fluctuations, also if embedded
  in a thermal noisy background. The measurement of the average voltage drop as a
  function of the noise intensity allows to infer the value of the stability index
  that characterizes Lévy-distributed fluctuations. An analytical estimate of the
  average velocity in the case of a Lévy-driven escape process from a metastable state
  well agrees with the numerical calculation of the average voltage drop across the
  junction. The best performances are reached at small bias currents and low temperatures,
  i.e., when both thermally activated and quantum tunneling switching processes can
  be neglected. The effects discussed in this work pave the way toward an effective
  and reliable method to characterize Lévy components eventually present in an unknown
  noisy signal. o̧pyright 2020 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

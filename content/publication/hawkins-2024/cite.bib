 abstract = {Distributing quantum correlations to each node of a network is a key aspect of quantum networking. Here, we present a robust, physically-motivated protocol by which global quantum correlations, as characterised by the discord, can be distributed to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers which possess only classical correlations. In addition to this, said distribution is measurement-outcome independent, and the distribution is done using only bilocal unitary operations and projective measurements. We also explore the scaling of this protocol for larger networks and illustrate the structure of the quantum correlations, showing its dependence on the local operations performed.},

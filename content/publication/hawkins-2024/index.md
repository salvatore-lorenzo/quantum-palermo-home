abstract: Distributing quantum correlations to each node of a network is a key aspect
  of quantum networking. Here, we present a robust, physically-motivated protocol
  by which global quantum correlations, as characterised by the discord, can be distributed
  to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers which possess only
  classical correlations. In addition to this, said distribution is measurement-outcome
  independent, and the distribution is done using only bilocal unitary operations
  and projective measurements. We also explore the scaling of this protocol for larger
  networks and illustrate the structure of the quantum correlations, showing its dependence
  on the local operations performed.

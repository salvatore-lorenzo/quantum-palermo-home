abstract: Newton's constant is the least well-measured among the fundamental constants
  of Nature, and, indeed, its accurate measurement has long served an experimental
  challenge. Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their
  promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring
  the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical
  interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation
  of Newtonâ€™s constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several
  orders of magnitude.

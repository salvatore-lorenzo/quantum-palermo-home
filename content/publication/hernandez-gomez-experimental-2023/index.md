abstract: Abstract We report on the experimental quantification of the contribution
  to non-equilibrium entropy production stemming from the quantum coherence content
  in the initial state of a qubit exposed to both coherent driving and dissipation.
  Our experimental demonstration builds on the exquisite experimental control of the
  spin state of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond and is underpinned, theoretically,
  by the formulation of a generalized fluctuation theorem designed to track the effects
  of quantum coherence. Our results provide significant evidence of the possibility
  to pinpoint the genuinely quantum mechanical contributions to the thermodynamics
  of non-equilibrium quantum processes in an open quantum systems scenario.

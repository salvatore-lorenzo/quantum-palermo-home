abstract: This letter focuses on open challenges in the fields of environmental data
  analysis and ecological complex systems. It highlights relations between research
  problems in stochastic population dynamics, machine learning and big data research,
  and statistical physics. Recent and current developments in statistical modeling
  of spatiotemporal data and in population dynamics are briefly reviewed. The presentation
  emphasizes stochastic fluctuations, including their statistical representation,
  data-based estimation, prediction, and impact on the physics of the underlying systems.
  Guided by the common thread of stochasticity, a deeper and improved understanding
  of environmental processes and ecosystems can be achieved by forging stronger interdisciplinary
  connections between statistical physics, spatiotemporal data modeling, and ecology.

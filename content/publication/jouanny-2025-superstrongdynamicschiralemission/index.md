abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich
  quantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian quantum
  models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization
  of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of
  waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study
  a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA),
  thus implementing a emphgiant atom in a structured photonic environment. The non-local
  coupling produces interference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction
  with long-wavelength (low-effective k), symmetric modes about the array center,
  while suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a subset
  of symmetric, low-effective k modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In
  this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized
  eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency
  of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements
  of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings
  model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion
  symmetry, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left
  of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission
  protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter
  interaction in a structured photonic environment.

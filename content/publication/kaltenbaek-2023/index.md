abstract: Abstract The objective of the proposed macroscopic quantum resonators (MAQRO)
  mission is to harness space for achieving long free-fall times, extreme vacuum,
  nano-gravity, and cryogenic temperatures to test the foundations of physics in macroscopic
  quantum experiments at the interface with gravity. Developing the necessary technologies,
  achieving the required sensitivities and providing the necessary isolation of macroscopic
  quantum systems from their environment will lay the path for developing novel quantum
  sensors. Earlier studies showed that the proposal is feasible but that several critical
  challenges remain, and key technologies need to be developed. Recent scientific
  and technological developments since the original proposal of MAQRO promise the
  potential for achieving additional science objectives. The proposed research campaign
  aims to advance the state of the art and to perform the first macroscopic quantum
  experiments in space. Experiments on the ground, in micro-gravity, and in space
  will drive the proposed research campaign during the current decade to enable the
  implementation of MAQRO within the subsequent decade.

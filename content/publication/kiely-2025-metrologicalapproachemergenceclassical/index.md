abstract: We present a precise characterization of the onset of classicality that
  combines the formalism of quantum Darwinism with the tools from quantum metrology.
  We show that the quantum Fisher information provides a useful metric for assessing
  the rate at which classical objectivity emerges. Furthermore, our formalism allows
  us to explore how the choice of measurement impacts the precision with which an
  observer can determine the state of the system. For a paradigmatic example of the
  spin-star model, we demonstrate that optimal measurements lead to the emergence
  of classicality at an exponential rate. Although other measurements necessarily
  lead to slower emergence, we importantly show that suboptimal measurements can still
  saturate the Cramér-Rao bound. By recasting emergent classicality as an information
  acquisition protocol, our framework provides a precise operational description of
  quantum Darwinism.

abstract: The effect of the amplitude of depressing and potentiating pulses on the
  synaptic plasticity (potentiation and depression) of a memristive device based on
  the Ta/ZrO2(Y)/Pt stack has been experimentally studied. It is shown that the amplitude
  of depressing and potentiating pulses affects the synaptic plasticity, namely, the
  value of current passing through the memristive device. The presented results demonstrate
  the prospects of using the ZrO2(Y)-based memristive devices as stable and low-power
  elements of neuromorphic systems.

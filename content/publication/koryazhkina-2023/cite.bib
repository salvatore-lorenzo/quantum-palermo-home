 abstract = {Herein, the effect of training pulse parameters on the synaptic plasticity of a ZrO2(Y)-based memristive device has been investigated. It is shown that the potentiation and depression significantly depend on the amplitude and shape of the training pulses. The most stable synaptic plasticity is observed when considering training pulses with rectangular shape and maximum amplitude value. In contrast, there is a rather weak dependence of the potentiation and depression on the number of pulses in trains. The observed effect can be explained in terms of the work required to change the resistive state. Moreover, a ZrO2(Y)-based memristive device exhibits distinguishable potentiation and depression for at least 1000 cycles. oÌ§pyright 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

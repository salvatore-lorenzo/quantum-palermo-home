abstract: Herein, the effect of training pulse parameters on the synaptic plasticity
  of a ZrO2(Y)-based memristive device has been investigated. It is shown that the
  potentiation and depression significantly depend on the amplitude and shape of the
  training pulses. The most stable synaptic plasticity is observed when considering
  training pulses with rectangular shape and maximum amplitude value. In contrast,
  there is a rather weak dependence of the potentiation and depression on the number
  of pulses in trains. The observed effect can be explained in terms of the work required
  to change the resistive state. Moreover, a ZrO2(Y)-based memristive device exhibits
  distinguishable potentiation and depression for at least 1000 cycles. oÌ§pyright

 abstract = {The effect of the amplitude of depressing and potentiating pulses on the synaptic plasticity (potentiation and depression) of a memristive device based on the Ta/ZrO2(Y)/Pt stack has been experimentally studied. It is shown that the amplitude of depressing and potentiating pulses affects the synaptic plasticity, namely, the value of current passing through the memristive device. The presented results demonstrate the prospects of using the ZrO2(Y)-based memristive devices as stable and low-power elements of neuromorphic systems.},

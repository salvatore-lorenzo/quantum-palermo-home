abstract: The effects of external digitally synthesized Gaussian noise on the resistive
  state relaxation time of a ZrO2(Y)-based memristive device when switching from a
  low resistance state to a high resistance state have been experimentally investigated.
  A nonmonotonic dependence of the resistive state relaxation time on the external
  noise intensity is found. This behavior is interpreted as a manifestation of the
  noise-enhanced stability effect previously observed in various complex systems with
  metastable states. It is shown that the experimental results agree satisfactorily
  with the theoretical ones. The presented results indicate the constructive role
  of external noise and its possible use as a mechanism for controlling the kinetics
  of resistive switching.

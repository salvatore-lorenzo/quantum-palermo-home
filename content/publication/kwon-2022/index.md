abstract: The resistive switching and synaptic behavior of a fabricated Ti/HfO2/Pt
  crossbar array device are investigated. The results demonstrated that TiOx layers
  are created by the movement of oxygen ions during the positive SET process, thereby
  improving the endurance and multilevel switching behavior of the device. The random
  properties of SET process were described with the help of stochastic model of memristor
  based on the length of conductive filament. The analysis of the mean first passage
  time allows estimating the parameters of the dielectric switching layer such as
  the activation energy of the diffusive defects, its variation under the influence
  of the driving voltage and the value of the working temperature. Furthermore, the
  conductive mechanism of the Ti/HfO2/Pt device with temperature variations and Schottky
  emission fitting was studied. Furthermore, the potentiation, depression, and the
  spike-time dependent plasticity behavior of the Ti/HfO2/Pt devices have been demonstrated
  by well-designed pulse inputs. The observed gradual change in conductance is suitable
  for a synaptic device in a neuromorphic system. oÌ§pyright 2022 Elsevier Ltd

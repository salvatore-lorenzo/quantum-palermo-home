abstract: Entropy production is a key quantity in any finite-time thermodynamic process.
  It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool
  to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to non-equilibrium processes.
  It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of
  logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry
  and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy
  production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet
  been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics,
  open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress
  in such endeavour. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments
  able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production
  on them. This paper aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the
  description, assessment and manipulation of entropy production. We present both
  formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential
  quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments.

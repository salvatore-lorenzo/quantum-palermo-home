abstract: "The act of measuring a system has profound consequences of dynamical and
  thermodynamic nature. In particular, the degree of irreversibility ensuing from
  a non-equilibrium process is strongly affected by measurements aimed at acquiring
  information on the state of a system of interest: the conditional and unconditional
  entropy production, which quantify the degree of irreversibility of the open system's
  dynamics, are related to each other by clearly interpreted informational quantities.
  Building on a recently proposed collisional-model framework [G. T. Landi Ä±t et al.,
  arXiv:2103.06247], we investigate the case of continuous-variable information carriers
  prepared in Gaussian states and undergoing Gaussian processes. We build up a toolbox
  that fully characterizes the thermodynamics of continuously measured non-equilibrium
  Gaussian systems and processes, illustrating how the instruments hereby introduced
  provide key insight into recent experiments on mesoscopic quantum systems [Phys.
  Rev. Lett, bf 125, 080601 (2020)]."

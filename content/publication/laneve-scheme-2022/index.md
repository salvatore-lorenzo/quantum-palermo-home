abstract: Abstract The ability to reliably distribute entanglement among the nodes
  of a network is an essential requirement for the development of effective quantum
  communication protocols and the realization of useful quantum networks. It has been
  demonstrated, in different contexts, that two remote systems can be entangled via
  local interactions with a carrier system that always remains in a separable state
  with respect to such distant particles. We develop a strategy for entanglement distribution
  via separable carriers that can be applied to any number of network nodes to achieve
  various entanglement distribution patterns. We show that our protocol results in
  multipartite entanglement, while the carrier mediating the process is always in
  a separable state with respect to the network. We provide examples showcasing the
  flexibility of our approach and propose a scheme of principle for the experimental
  demonstration of the protocol.

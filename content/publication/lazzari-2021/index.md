abstract: We present a new stochastic model, based on a 0-dimensional version of the
  well known biogeochemical flux model (BFM), which allows to take into account the
  temperature random fluctuations present in natural systems and therefore to describe
  more realistically the dynamics of real marine ecosystems. The study presents a
  detailed analysis of the effects of randomly varying temperature on the lower trophic
  levels of the food web and ocean biogeochemical processes. More in detail, the temperature
  is described as a stochastic process driven by an additive self-correlated Gaussian
  noise. Varying both correlation time and intensity of the noise source, the predominance
  of different plankton populations is observed, with regimes shifted towards the
  coexistence or the exclusion of some populations. Finally a Fourier analysis carried
  out on the time series of the plankton populations shows how the ecosystem responds
  to the seasonal driving for different values of the noise intensity. oÌ§pyright 2021

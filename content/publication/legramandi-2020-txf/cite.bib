 abstract = {We classify AdS3 solutions preserving \$\$ \mathcal\N\ \$\$= (8, 0) supersymmetry in ten and eleven dimensions and find the local form of each of them. These include the AdS3×S6 solution of [1] and the embeddings of AdS3 into AdS4×S7, AdS5×S5, AdS7/ℤk×S4 and its IIA reduction within AdS7. More interestingly we find solutions preserving the superconformal algebras \$\$ \\mathfrak\f\\_4,\mathfrak\su\\left(1,1\textbar4\right),\mathfrak\osp\\left(\4\\textasciicircum\\ast \\textbar4\right) \$\$on certain squashings of the 7-sphere. These solutions asymptote to AdS4×S7 and are promising candidates for holographic duals to defects in Chern-Simons matter theories.},

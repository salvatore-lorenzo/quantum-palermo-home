abstract: We classify AdS$_3$ solutions preserving N=(8,0) supersymmetry in ten and
  eleven dimensions and find the local form of each of them. These include the AdS$_3times$S$^6$
  solution of Dibitetto:2018ftj and the embeddings of AdS$_3$ into AdS$_4times$S$^7$,
  AdS$_5times$S$^5$, AdS$_7$/ZtextsubscriptkÃ—S$^4$ and its IIA reduction within AdS$_7$.
  More interestingly we find solutions preserving the superconformal algebras f$_4$,
  su(1,1textbar4), osp(4textsuperscript*textbar4) on certain squashings of the 7-sphere.
  These solutions asymptote to AdS$_4times$S$^7$ and are promising candidates for
  holographic duals to defects in Chern-Simons matter theories.

abstract: Dressed states forming when quantum emitters or atoms couple to a photonic
  bath underpin a number of phenomena and applications, in particular nonradiating
  effective interactions occurring within photonic bandgaps. Here, we present a compact
  formulation of the resolvent-based theory for calculating atom-photon dressed states
  built on the idea that the atom behaves as an effective impurity. This establishes
  an explicit connection with the standard impurity problem in condensed matter. Moreover,
  it allows us to formulate and settle-independently of the bath Hamiltonian-A number
  of properties previously known only for specific models or not entirely formalized.
  The framework is next extended to the case of more than one emitter, which is used
  to derive a general expression of dissipationless effective Hamiltonians explicitly
  featuring the overlap of single-emitter dressed bound states.

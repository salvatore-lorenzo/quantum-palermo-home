abstract: We present a general framework to tackle quantum optics problems with giant
  atoms, i.e. quantum emitters each coupled Ä±t non-locally to a structured photonic
  bath (typically a lattice) of any dimension. The theory encompasses the calculation
  and general properties of Green's functions, atom-photon bound states (BSs), collective
  master equations and decoherence-free Hamiltonians (DFHs), and is underpinned by
  a formalism where a giant atom is formally viewed as a normal atom lying at a fictitious
  location. As a major application, we provide for the first time a general criterion
  to predict/engineer DFHs of giant atoms, which can be applied both in and out of
  the photonic continuum and regardless of the structure or dimensionality of the
  photonic bath. This is used to show novel DFHs in 2D baths such as a square lattice
  and photonic graphene

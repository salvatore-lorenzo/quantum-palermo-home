abstract: We study the dynamics of a chain of interacting quantum particles affected
  by an individual or collective environment(s), focusing on the role played by the
  environmental quantum correlations over the evolution of the chain. The presence
  of entanglement in the state of the environment magnifies the non-Markovian nature
  of the chain's dynamics, giving rise to structures in figures of merit such as spin
  entanglement and purity that are not observed under a separable environmental state.
  Our analysis can be relevant to problems tackling the open-system dynamics of biological
  complexes of strong current interest. oÌ§pyright 2011 American Physical Society.

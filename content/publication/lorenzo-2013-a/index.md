abstract: We introduce a tool for the quantitative characterization of the departure
  from Markovianity of a given dynamical process. Our tool can be applied to a generic
  N-level system and extended straightforwardly to Gaussian continuous-variable systems.
  It is linked to the change of the volume of physical states that are dynamically
  accessible to a system and provides qualitative expectations in agreement with some
  of the analogous tools proposed so far. We illustrate its predictive power by tackling
  a few canonical examples. oÌ§pyright 2013 American Physical Society.

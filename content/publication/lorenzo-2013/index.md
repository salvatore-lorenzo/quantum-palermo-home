abstract: We study the interplay between forgetful and memory-keeping evolution enforced
  on a two-level system by a multi-spin environment whose elements are coupled to
  local bosonic baths. Contrarily to the expectation that any non-Markovian effect
  would be buried by the forgetful mechanism induced by the spin-bath coupling, one
  can actually induce a full Markovian-to-non-Markovian transition of the two-level
  system's dynamics, controllable by parameters such as the mismatch between the energy
  of the two-level system and of the spin environment. For a symmetric coupling, the
  amount of non-Markovianity surprisingly grows with the number of decoherence channels.

abstract: We study the dynamics of heat flux in the thermalization process of a pair
  of identical quantum systems that interact dissipatively with a reservoir in a cascaded
  fashion. Despite that the open dynamics of the bipartite system S is globally Lindbladian,
  one of the subsystems \"sees\" the reservoir in a state modified by the interaction
  with the other subsystem and hence it undergoes a non-Markovian dynamics. As a consequence,
  the heat flow exhibits a nonexponential time behavior which can greatly deviate
  from the case where each party is independently coupled to the reservoir. We investigate
  both thermal and correlated initial states of S and show that the presence of correlations
  at the beginning can considerably affect the heat-flux rate. We carry out our study
  in two paradigmatic cases - a pair of harmonic oscillators with a reservoir of bosonic
  modes and two qubits with a reservoir of fermionic modes - and compare the corresponding
  behaviors. In the case of qubits and for initial thermal states, we find that the
  trace distance discord is at any time interpretable as the correlated contribution
  to the total heat flux.

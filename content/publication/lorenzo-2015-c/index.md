abstract: We investigate the link between information and thermodynamics embodied
  by Landauer's principle in the open dynamics of a multipartite quantum system. Such
  irreversible dynamics is described in terms of a collisional model with a finite
  temperature reservoir. We demonstrate that Landauer's principle holds, for such
  a configuration, in a form that involves the flow of heat dissipated into the environment
  and the rate of change of the entropy of the system. Quite remarkably, such a principle
  for heat and entropy power can be explicitly linked to the rate of creation of correlations
  among the elements of the multipartite system and, in turn, the non-Markovian nature
  of their reduced evolution. Such features are illustrated in two exemplary cases.

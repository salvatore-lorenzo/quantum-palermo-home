abstract: We investigate the fidelity of the quantum state transfer (QST) of two qubits
  by means of an arbitrary spin-12 network, on a lattice of any dimensionality. Under
  the assumptions that the network Hamiltonian preserves the magnetization and that
  a fully polarized initial state is taken for the lattice, we obtain a general formula
  for the average fidelity of the two qubits QST, linking it to the one- and two-particle
  transfer amplitudes of the spin excitations among the sites of the lattice. We then
  apply this formalism to a 1D spin chain with XX-Heisenberg type nearest-neighbour
  interactions adopting a protocol that is a generalization of the single qubit one
  proposed in Paganelli et al. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062309 (2013)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.87.062309].
  We find that a high-quality two qubit QST can be achieved provided one can control
  the local fields at sites near the sender and receiver. Under such conditions, we
  obtain an almost perfect transfer in a time that scales either linearly or, depending
  on the spin number, quadratically with the length of the chain.

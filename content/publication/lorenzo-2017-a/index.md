abstract: It was recently shown [S. Lorenzo, F. Lombardo, F. Ciccarello and M. Palma,
  Sci. Rep. 7 (2017) 42729] that the presence of static disorder in a bosonic bath-whose
  normal modes thus become all Anderson-localized-leads to non-Markovianity in the
  emission of an atom weakly coupled to it (a process which in absence of disorder
  is fully Markovian). Here, we extend the above analysis beyond the weak-coupling
  regime for a finite-band bath so as to account for band edge effects. We study the
  interplay of these with static disorder in the emergence of non-Markovian behavior
  in terms of a suitable non-Markovianity measure.

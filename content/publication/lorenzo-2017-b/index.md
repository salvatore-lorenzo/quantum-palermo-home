abstract: Recently, a large class of quantum non-Markovian piecewise dynamics for
  an open quantum system obeying closed evolution equations has been introduced [1].
  These dynamics have been defined in terms of a waiting-time distribution between
  quantum jumps, along with quantum maps describing the effect of jumps and the system
  evolution between them. Here, we present a quantum collision model with memory,
  whose reduced dynamics in the continuous-time limit reproduces the above class of
  non-Markovian piecewise dynamics, thus providing an explicit microscopic realization.

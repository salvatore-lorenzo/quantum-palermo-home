abstract: 'A collision model (CM) is a framework to describe open quantum dynamics.
  In its memoryless version, it models the reservoir R as consisting of a large collection
  of elementary ancillas: The dynamics of the open system S results from successive
  collisions of S with the ancillas of R. Here, we present a general formulation of
  memoryless composite CMs, where S is partitioned into the very open system under
  study S coupled to one or more auxiliary systems Si. Their composite dynamics occurs
  through internal S-Si collisions interspersed with external ones involving Si and
  the reservoir R. We show that important known instances of quantum non-Markovian
  dynamics of S-such as the emission of an atom into a reservoir featuring a Lorentzian,
  or multi-Lorentzian, spectral density or a qubit subject to random telegraph noise-can
  be mapped on to such memoryless composite CMs.'

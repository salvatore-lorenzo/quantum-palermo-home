 abstract = {In this paper we discuss the implementation of 2-qubit quantum state transfer (QST) in inhomogeneous spin chains where the sender and the receiver blocks are coupled through the bulk channel via weak links. The fidelity and the typical timescale of the QST are discussed as a function of the parameters of the weak links. Given the possibility of implementing with cold atoms in optical lattices a variety of condensed matter systems, including spin systems, we also discuss the possible implementation of the discussed 2-qubit QST with cold gases with weak links, together with a discussion of the applications and limitations of the presented results.},

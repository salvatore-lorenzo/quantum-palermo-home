abstract: Universality is key to the theory of phase transitions, stating that the
  equilibrium properties of observables near a phase transition can be classified
  according to few critical exponents. These exponents rule an universal scaling behaviour
  that witnesses the irrelevance of the model's microscopic details at criticality.
  Here we discuss the persistence of such a scaling in a one-dimensional quantum Ising
  model under sinusoidal modulation in time of its transverse magnetic field. We show
  that scaling of various quantities (concurrence, entanglement entropy, magnetic
  and fidelity susceptibility) endures up to a stroboscopic time $Ï„$ bd, proportional
  to the size of the system. This behaviour is explained by noticing that the low-energy
  modes, responsible for the scaling properties, are resilient to the absorption of
  energy. Our results suggest that relevant features of the universality do hold also
  when the system is brought out-of-equilibrium by a periodic driving.

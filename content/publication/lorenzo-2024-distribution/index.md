abstract: Quantum state transfer protocols are a major toolkit in many quantum information
  processing tasks, from quantum key distribution to quantum computation. To assess
  performance of a such a protocol, one often relies on the average fidelity between
  the input and the output states. Going beyond this scheme, we analyze the entire
  probability distribution of fidelity, providing a general framework to derive it
  for the transfer of single- and two-qubit states. Starting from the delta-like shape
  of the fidelity distribution, characteristic to perfect transfer, we analyze its
  broadening and deformation due to realistic features of the process, including non-perfect
  read-out timing. Different models of quantum transfer, sharing the same value of
  the average fidelity, display different distributions of fidelity, providing thus
  additional information on the protocol, including the minimum fidelity.

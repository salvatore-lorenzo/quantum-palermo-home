abstract: To define the topology of driven systems, recent works have proposed synthetic
  dimensions as a way to uncover the underlying parameter space of topological invariants.
  Using time as a synthetic dimension, together with a momentum dimension, gives access
  to a synthetic two-dimensional (2D) Chern number. It is, however, still unclear
  how the synthetic 2D Chern number is related to the Chern number that is defined
  from a parametric variable that evolves with time. Here we show that in periodically
  driven systems in the adiabatic limit, the synthetic 2D Chern number is a multiple
  of the Chern number defined from the parametric variable. The synthetic 2D Chern
  number can thus be engineered via how the parametric variable evolves in its own
  space. We justify our claims by investigating Thouless pumping in two one-dimensional
  (1D) tight-binding models, a three-site chain model, and a two-1D-sliding-chains
  model. The present findings could be extended to higher dimensions and other periodically
  driven configurations.

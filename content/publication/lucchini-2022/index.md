abstract: The advent of ultrafast laser science offers the unique opportunity to combine
  Floquet engineering with extreme time resolution, further pushing the optical control
  of matter into the petahertz domain. However, what is the shortest driving pulse
  for which Floquet states can be realised remains an unsolved matter, thus limiting
  the application of Floquet theory to pulses composed by many optical cycles. Here
  we ionized Ne atoms with few-femtosecond pulses of selected time duration and show
  that a Floquet state can be observed already with a driving field that lasts for
  only 10 cycles. For shorter pulses, down to 2 cycles, the finite lifetime of the
  driven state can still be explained using an analytical model based on Floquet theory.
  By demonstrating that the amplitude and number of Floquet-like sidebands in the
  photoelectron spectrum can be controlled not only with the driving laser pulse intensity
  and frequency, but also by its duration, our results add a new lever to the toolbox
  of Floquet engineering. Floquet engineering aims at inducing new properties in materials
  with light. Here the authors have used pulses of variable durations, to investigate
  its applicability in the femtosecond domain. Surprisingly, they found that it holds
  to the few-cycle limit.

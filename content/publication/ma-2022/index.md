abstract: Charge neutrality and their expected itinerant nature makes excitons potential
  transmitters of information. However, exciton mobility remains inaccessible to traditional
  optical experiments that only create and detect excitons with negligible momentum.
  Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we detect dispersing excitons
  in the quasi-one-dimensional metallic trichalcogenide, TaSe3. The low density of
  conduction electrons and the low dimensionality in TaSe3 combined with a polaronic
  renormalization of the conduction band and the poorly screened interaction between
  these polarons and photo-induced valence holes leads to various excitonic bound
  states that we interpret as intrachain and interchain excitons, and possibly trions.
  The thresholds for the formation of a photo-hole together with an exciton appear
  as side valence bands with dispersions nearly parallel to the main valence band,
  but shifted to lower excitation energies. The energy separation between side and
  main valence bands can be controlled by surface doping, enabling the tuning of certain
  exciton properties. Mobile excitons in metals have been elusive, as screening usually
  suppresses their formation. Here, the authors demonstrate such mobile bound states
  in quasi-one-dimensional metallic TaSe3, taking advantage of its low dimensionality
  and carrier density.

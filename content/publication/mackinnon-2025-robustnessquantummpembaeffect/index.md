abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is a phenomenon observed in many-body systems
  where initial systems configurations farther from equilibrium can be observed to
  equilibrate faster than configurations that are closer to it. By considering noise
  induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness
  of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated
  thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad
  master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state,
  making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast,
  we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in U(1) symmetric random
  unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence
  of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation,
  we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a
  stronger QME.

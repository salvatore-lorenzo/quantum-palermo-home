 abstract = {We make use of the powerful formalism of quantum parameter estimation to assess the characteristic rates of a continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model affecting the motion of a massive mechanical system. We show that a study performed in non-equilibrium conditions unveils the advantages provided by the use of genuinely quantum resources---such as quantum correlations---in estimating the CSL-induced diffusion rate. In stationary conditions, instead, the gap between quantum performance and a classical scheme disappears. Our investigation contributes to the ongoing effort aimed at identifying suitable conditions for the experimental assessment of collapse models.},

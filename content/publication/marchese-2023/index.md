abstract: We make use of the powerful formalism of quantum parameter estimation to
  assess the characteristic rates of a continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model
  affecting the motion of a massive mechanical system. We show that a study performed
  in non-equilibrium conditions unveils the advantages provided by the use of genuinely
  quantum resources---such as quantum correlations---in estimating the CSL-induced
  diffusion rate. In stationary conditions, instead, the gap between quantum performance
  and a classical scheme disappears. Our investigation contributes to the ongoing
  effort aimed at identifying suitable conditions for the experimental assessment
  of collapse models.

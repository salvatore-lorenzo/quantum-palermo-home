 abstract = {We present a protocol to create entangled coherent states by engineering cross-Kerr interactions between bosonic systems endowed with (externally driven) internal spin-like degrees of freedom. With slight modifications, the protocol is also able to produce N00N states through nonlinear beam splitter interactions. Each bosonic system interacts locally with its spin and by suitably tuning the model parameters, various classes of effective bosonic interaction Hamiltonians, mediated by the coupled spins, can be engineered. Our approach is benchmarked by numerical simulations aimed at studying the entanglement within a bosonic register and comparing it with the expected one resulting from the target Hamiltonians.},

abstract: We present a protocol to create entangled coherent states by engineering
  cross-Kerr interactions between bosonic systems endowed with (externally driven)
  internal spin-like degrees of freedom. With slight modifications, the protocol is
  also able to produce N00N states through nonlinear beam splitter interactions. Each
  bosonic system interacts locally with its spin and by suitably tuning the model
  parameters, various classes of effective bosonic interaction Hamiltonians, mediated
  by the coupled spins, can be engineered. Our approach is benchmarked by numerical
  simulations aimed at studying the entanglement within a bosonic register and comparing
  it with the expected one resulting from the target Hamiltonians.

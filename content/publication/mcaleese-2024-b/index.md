abstract: Distributing entanglement over long distances remains a challenge due to
  its fragility when exposed to environmental effects. In this work, we compare various
  entanglement distribution protocols in a realistic noisy fiber network. We focus
  specifically on two schemes that only require the sending of a non-entangled carrier
  photon to remote nodes of the network. These protocols rely on optical CNOT gates
  and we vary the probability with which they can be successfully performed. Encoding
  our entangled states in photon polarization, we analyse the effect of depolarizing
  noise on the photonic states as the carrier passes through the fibers. Building
  a robust model of photon loss and calculating the distillable entanglement of the
  noisy states, we find the entanglement distribution rate. We discover that methods
  involving a separable carrier can reach a higher rate than the standard entanglement
  distribution protocol, provided that the success probability of the optical CNOT
  gates is sufficiently high.

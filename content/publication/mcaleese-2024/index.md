abstract: We assess a scheme for measurement-free quantum teleportation from the perspective
  of the resources underpinning its performance. In particular, we focus on recently
  made claims about the crucial role played by the degree of non-Markovianity of the
  dynamics of the information carrier whose state we aim to teleport. We prove that
  any link between efficiency of teleportation and back-flow of information depends
  fundamentally on the way the various operations entailed by the measurement-free
  teleportation protocol are implemented, while - in general - no claim of causal
  link can be made. Our result reinforces the need for the explicit assessment of
  the underlying physical platform when assessing the performance and resources for
  a given quantum protocol and the need for a rigorous quantum resource theory of
  non-Markovianity.

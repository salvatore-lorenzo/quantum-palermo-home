abstract: Standard quantum metrology relies on ensemble-averaged quantities, such
  as the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), which often mask the fluctuations inherent
  to single-shot realizations. In this work, we bridge the gap between quantum information
  geometry and stochastic thermodynamics by introducing the Conditional Quantum Fisher
  Information (CQFI). Defined via the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, the CQFI generalizes
  the classical stochastic Fisher information to the quantum domain. We demonstrate
  that the CQFI admits a decomposition into incoherent (population) and coherent (basis
  rotation) contributions, augmented by a transient interference cross-term absent
  at the ensemble level. Crucially, we show that this cross-term can be negative,
  signaling destructive interference between classical and quantum information channels
  along individual trajectories. Leveraging this framework, we construct a stochastic
  information geometry that defines thermodynamic length and action for single quantum
  trajectories. Finally, we derive fundamental quantum speed limits valid at the single-trajectory
  level and validate our results using the quantum jump unraveling of a driven thermal
  qubit.

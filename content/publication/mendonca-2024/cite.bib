 abstract = {We describe and analyze a quantum thermometer based on a multi-layered collisional model. The proposed architecture provides significant sensitivity even for short interaction times between the ancillae comprised in the thermometer and the system to be probed, and a small number of information-acquiring collisions. The assessment of the flow of information taking place within the layered thermometer and between system and thermometer reveals that the tuning of the mutual backflow of information has a positive influence on the precision of thermometry, and helps unveiling the information-theoretic mechanisms behind the working principles of the proposed architecture.},

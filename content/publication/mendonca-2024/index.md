abstract: We describe and analyze a quantum thermometer based on a multi-layered collisional
  model. The proposed architecture provides significant sensitivity even for short
  interaction times between the ancillae comprised in the thermometer and the system
  to be probed, and a small number of information-acquiring collisions. The assessment
  of the flow of information taking place within the layered thermometer and between
  system and thermometer reveals that the tuning of the mutual backflow of information
  has a positive influence on the precision of thermometry, and helps unveiling the
  information-theoretic mechanisms behind the working principles of the proposed architecture.

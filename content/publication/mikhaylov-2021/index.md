abstract: The stochastic resonance phenomenon has been studied experimentally and
  theoretically for a state-of-art metal-oxide memristive device based on yttria-stabilized
  zirconium dioxide and tantalum pentoxide, which exhibits bipolar filamentary resistive
  switching of anionic type. The effect of white Gaussian noise superimposed on the
  sub-threshold sinusoidal driving signal is analyzed through the time series statistics
  of the resistive switching parameters, the spectral response to a periodic perturbation
  and the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the nonlinear system. The stabilized
  resistive switching and the increased memristance response are revealed in the observed
  regularities at an optimal noise intensity corresponding to the stochastic resonance
  phenomenon and interpreted using a stochastic memristor model taking into account
  an external noise source added to the control voltage. The obtained results clearly
  show that noise and fluctuations can play a constructive role in nonlinear memristive
  systems far from equilibrium.

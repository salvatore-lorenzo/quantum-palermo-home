abstract: Quantum information scrambling (QIS) is a characteristic feature of several
  quantum systems, ranging from black holes to quantum communication networks. While
  accurately quantifying QIS is crucial to understanding many such phenomena, common
  approaches based on the tripartite information have limitations due to the accessibility
  issues of quantum mutual information, and do not always properly take into consideration
  the dependence on the encoding input basis. To address these issues, we propose
  a novel and computationally efficient QIS quantifier, based on a formulation of
  QIS in terms of quantum state discrimination. We show that the optimal guessing
  probability, which reflects the degree of QIS induced by an isometric quantum evolution,
  is directly connected to the accessible min-information, a generalized channel capacity
  based on conditional min-entropy, which can be cast as a convex program and thus
  computed efficiently. By applying our proposal to a range of examples with increasing
  complexity, we illustrate its ability to capture the multifaceted nature of QIS
  in all its intricacy.

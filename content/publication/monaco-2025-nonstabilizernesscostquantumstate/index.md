abstract: We study the non-stabilizer resources required to achieve informational
  completeness in single-setting quantum state estimation scenarios. We consider fixed-basis
  projective measurements preceded by quantum circuits acting on n-qubit input states,
  allowing ancillary qubits to increase retrievable information. We prove that when
  only stabilizer resources are allowed, these strategies are always informationally
  equivalent to projective measurements in a stabilizer basis, and therefore never
  informationally complete, regardless of the number of ancillas. We then show that
  incorporating T gates enlarges the accessible information. Specifically, we prove
  that at least 2n/log23 such gates are necessary for informational completeness,
  and that 2n suffice. We conjecture that 2n gates are indeed both necessary and sufficient.
  Finally, we unveil a tight connection between entanglement structure and informational
  power of measurements implemented with t-doped Clifford circuits. Our results recast
  notions of \"magic\" and stabilizerness - typically framed in computational terms
  - into the setting of quantum metrology.

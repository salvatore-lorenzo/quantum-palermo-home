 abstract = {We report on an experiment achieving the dynamical generation of non-Gaussian states of motion of a levitated optomechanical system. We access intrinsic Duffing-like non-linearities by squeezing an oscillator's state of motion through rapidly switching the frequency of its trap. We characterize the experimental non-Gaussian state against expectations from simulations and give prospects for the emergence of genuine non-classical features.},

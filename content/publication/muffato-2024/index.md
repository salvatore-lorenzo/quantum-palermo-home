abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior.
  Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking
  experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction
  of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size,
  an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects.
  Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental
  physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum
  sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an
  unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical
  system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with
  a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild
  modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in
  this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions
  of the trapped nanoparticle.

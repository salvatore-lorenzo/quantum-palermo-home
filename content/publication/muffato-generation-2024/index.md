abstract: We report on an experiment achieving the dynamical generation of non-Gaussian
  states of motion of a levitated optomechanical system. We access intrinsic Duffing-like
  non-linearities by squeezing an oscillator's state of motion through rapidly switching
  the frequency of its trap. We characterize the experimental non-Gaussian state against
  expectations from simulations and give prospects for the emergence of genuine non-classical
  features.

abstract: We investigate machine learning-based noise classification aimed at the
  recognition of the Markovian character of a dynamics and the identification of correlations
  of classical noise, as well as their interplay in small quantum networks. We operate
  control based on Coherent Tunneling by Adiabatic Passage (CTAP) or Stimulated Raman
  Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in a three-level system using different pulse configurations
  as inputs to train a feedforward neural network. Our results show that supervised
  learning can classify distinct types of classical diagonal noise affecting the system.
  Three non-Markovian (quasistatic correlated, anti-correlated, and uncorrelated)
  and Markovian noise mechanisms are classified with $99%$ accuracy. Instead, correlations
  of Markovian noises cannot be classified with our method. The approach is robust
  against statistical measurement errors keeping its effectiveness even for physical
  measurements where a limited number of samples is available.

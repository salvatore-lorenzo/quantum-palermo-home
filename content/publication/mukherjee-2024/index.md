abstract: We investigate a machine learning based classification of noise acting on
  a small quantum network with the aim of detecting spatial or multilevel correlations,
  and the interplay with Markovianity. We control a three-level system by inducing
  coherent population transfer exploiting different pulse amplitude combinations as
  inputs to train a feedforward neural network. We show that supervised learning can
  classify different types of classical dephasing noise affecting the system. Three
  non-Markovian (quasi-static correlated, anti-correlated and uncorrelated) and Markovian
  noises are classified with more than 99% accuracy. On the contrary, correlations
  of Markovian noise cannot be discriminated with our method. Our approach is robust
  to statistical measurement errors and retains its effectiveness for physical measurements
  where only a limited number of samples is available making it very experimental-friendly.
  Our result paves the way for classifying spatial correlations of noise in quantum
  architectures.

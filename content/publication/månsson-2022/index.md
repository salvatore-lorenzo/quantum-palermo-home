abstract: Abstract The dynamics of biologically relevant molecules exposed to ionizing
  radiation contains many facets and spans several orders of magnitude in time and
  energy. In the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range, multi-electronic phenomena
  and bands of correlated states with inner-valence holes must be accounted for in
  addition to a plethora of vibrational modes and available dissociation channels.
  To be able to track changes in charge density and bond length during ultrafast reactions
  is an important endeavour towards more general abilities to simulate and control
  photochemical processes, possibly inspired by those that have evolved biologically.
  By using attosecond XUV pulses extending up to 35 eV and few-femtosecond near-infrared
  pulses, we have previously time-resolved correlated electronic dynamics and charge
  migration occurring in the biologically relevant molecule adenine after XUV-induced
  sudden ionization. Here, by using additional experimental data, we comprehensively
  report on both electronic and vibrational dynamics of this nucleobase in an energy
  range little explored to date with high temporal resolution. The time-dependent
  yields of parent and fragment ions in mass spectra are analysed to extract exponential
  time constants and oscillation periods. Together with time-dependent density functional
  theory and ab-initio Green’s function methods, we identify different vibrational
  and electronic processes. Beyond providing further insights into the XUV-induced
  dynamics of an important nucleobase, our work demonstrates that yields of specific
  dissociation outcomes can be influenced by sufficiently well-timed ultrashort pulses,
  therefore providing a new route for the control of the multi-electronic and dissociative
  dynamics of a DNA building block.

abstract: We explore pump-probe high harmonic generation (HHG) from monolayer hexagonal-boron-nitride,
  where a terahertz pump excites coherent optical phonons that are subsequently probed
  by an intense infrared pulse that drives HHG. We find, through state-of-the-art
  ab initio calculations, that the structure of the emission spectrum is attenuated
  by the presence of coherent phonons and no longer comprises discrete harmonic orders,
  but rather a continuous emission in the plateau region. The HHG yield strongly oscillates
  as a function of the pump-probe delay, corresponding to ultrafast changes in the
  lattice such as specific bond compression or stretching dynamics. We further show
  that in the regime where the excited phonon period and the pulse duration are of
  the same order of magnitude, the HHG process becomes sensitive to the carrier-envelope
  phase (CEP) of the driving field, even though the pulse duration is so long that
  no such sensitivity is observed in the absence of coherent phonons. The degree of
  CEP sensitivity versus pump-probe delay is shown to be a highly selective measure
  for instantaneous structural changes in the lattice, providing an approach for ultrafast
  multidimensional HHG spectroscopy. Remarkably, the obtained temporal resolution
  for phonon dynamics is ∼1 femtosecond, which is much shorter than the probe pulse
  duration because of the inherent subcycle contrast mechanism. Our work paves the
  way toward routes of probing phonons and ultrafast material structural changes with
  subcycle temporal resolution and provides a mechanism for controlling the HHG spectrum.

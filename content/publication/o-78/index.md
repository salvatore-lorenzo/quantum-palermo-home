abstract: Excitons, quasi-particles generated by the Coulomb interaction between an
  excited electron and a hole, have been proposed as a possibility to overcome the
  limits of electronics. To fully exploit them, a deeper understanding of their interaction
  with light is required. In this study, the interaction of a core exciton with an
  intense, few-femtosecond infrared pulse is investigated with attosecond transient
  reflection spectroscopy in a bulk monocrystalline MgF2 sample. The distinct few-
  and sub-femtosecond optical responses attest the dual, atomic- and solid-like, nature
  of core excitons. Sub-femtosecond dynamics, in particular, are dictated by the interplay
  between the exciton and the conduction band of the crystal. Theoretical simulations
  allow to propose the exciton binding energy as a lever to control exciton dynamics
  on an ultrafast timescale.

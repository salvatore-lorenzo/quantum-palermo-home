abstract: Despite the observation of cyclic and chaotic dynamics in nature, it is
  still not clear whether this behaviour is inherent to ecological systems or caused
  by external forcings. Here we explored a set of approximately 210,000 simulations
  to assess how often a model of realistic complexity exhibits non-stationary dynamics
  when external perturbations are excluded. Remarkably, less than one third of the
  population shown non-stationary dynamics and, even when present, fluctuations were
  rather small. The inherent stability of plankton communities showed to be related
  to the presence of multiple feedbacks in the food web structure, omnivory, low centre
  of gravity, and supports the conclusion that food webs of realistic complexity rarely
  exhibit significant endogenous non-stationary dynamics. Finally, we computed Lyapunov
  exponents for the non-stationary trajectories, in order to assess in which proportion
  they were periodic or chaotic, and we concluded that less than 10% of the non-stationary
  trajectories (3% of the total) showed sensitivities to initial conditions. This
  further supports the conclusion that complex topology mainly damps endogenous fluctuations
  in the food web. oÌ§pyright 2023 The Author(s)

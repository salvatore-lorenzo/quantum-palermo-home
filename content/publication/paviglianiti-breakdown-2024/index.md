abstract: The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally
  described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced
  phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged
  observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately,
  making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of
  MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome.
  This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe
  a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an
  exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations
  are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the
  correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate
  that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale,
  beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial
  averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations,
  thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.

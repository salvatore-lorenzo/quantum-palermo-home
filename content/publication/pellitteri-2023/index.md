abstract: The interaction between a light mode and a mechanical oscillator via radiation
  pressure in optomechanical systems is an excellent platform for a multitude of applications
  in quantum technologies. In this work we study the dynamics of a pair of optomechanical
  systems interacting dissipatively with a wave guide in a unidirectional way. Focusing
  on the regime where the cavity modes can be adiabatically eliminated, we derive
  an effective coupling between the two mechanical modes and explore the classical
  and quantum correlations established between the modes in both the transient and
  the stationary regime, highlighting their asymmmetrical nature due to the unidirectional
  coupling. Noteworthy, we find that a constant amount of steady correlations can
  exist at long times. Furthermore we show that this unidirectional coupling establishes
  a temperature gradient between the mirrors, depending on the frequencies' detuning.
  We additionally analyze the power spectrum of the output guide field and we show
  how, thanks to the chiral coupling, from such spectrum it is possible to reconstruct
  the spectra of each single mirror.

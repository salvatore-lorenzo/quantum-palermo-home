 abstract = {Extracting meaningful information about unknown quantum states without performing a full tomography is an important task. Low-dimensional projections and random measurements can provide such insight but typically require careful crafting. In this paper, we present an optical scheme based on sending unknown input states through a multimode fiber and performing two-point intensity and coincidence measurements. A short multimode fiber implements effectively a random projection in the spatial domain, while a long-dispersive multimode fiber performs a spatial and spectral projection. We experimentally show that useful properties, i.e., the purity, dimensionality, and degree of indistinguishability of various states of light including spectrally entangled biphoton states, can be obtained by measuring statistical properties of single counts and their correlation between two outputs over many realizations of unknown random projections. Moreover, we show that this information can then be used for state classification.},

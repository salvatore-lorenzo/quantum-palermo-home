abstract: Extracting meaningful information about unknown quantum states without performing
  a full tomography is an important task. Low-dimensional projections and random measurements
  can provide such insight but typically require careful crafting. In this paper,
  we present an optical scheme based on sending unknown input states through a multimode
  fiber and performing two-point intensity and coincidence measurements. A short multimode
  fiber implements effectively a random projection in the spatial domain, while a
  long-dispersive multimode fiber performs a spatial and spectral projection. We experimentally
  show that useful properties, i.e., the purity, dimensionality, and degree of indistinguishability
  of various states of light including spectrally entangled biphoton states, can be
  obtained by measuring statistical properties of single counts and their correlation
  between two outputs over many realizations of unknown random projections. Moreover,
  we show that this information can then be used for state classification.

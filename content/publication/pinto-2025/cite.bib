 abstract = {We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, 
due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. 
For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, 
causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, 
either to the right or to the left of the qubit depending on its frequency. 
For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. 
This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, 
despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confines the motion of the emitted photon. 
In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally 
analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a 
photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.},

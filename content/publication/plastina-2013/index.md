abstract: We analyze the non-Markovian character of the dynamics of an open two-level
  atom interacting with a gas of ultra-cold fermions. In particular, we discuss the
  connection between the phenomena of orthogonality catastrophe and Fermi edge singularity
  occurring in such a kind of environment and the memory-keeping effects which are
  displayed in the time evolution of the open system. oÌ§pyright 2013 World Scientific

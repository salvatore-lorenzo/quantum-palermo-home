abstract: The characterization of quantum critical phenomena is pivotal for the understanding
  and harnessing of quantum many-body physics. However, their complexity makes the
  inference of such fundamental processes difficult. Thus, efficient and experimentally
  non-demanding methods for their diagnosis are strongly desired. Here, we introduce
  a general scheme, based on the combination of finite-size scaling and the linear
  response of a given observable to a time-dependent perturbation, to efficiently
  extract the energy gaps to the lowest excited states of the system, and thus infer
  its dynamical critical exponents. Remarkably, the scheme is able to tackle both
  integrable and non-integrable models, prepared away from their ground states. It
  thus holds the potential to embody a valuable diagnostic tool for experimentally
  significant problems in quantum many-body physics.

abstract: We consider a finite one-dimensional chain of quantum rotors interacting
  with a set of thermal baths at different temperatures. When the interaction between
  the rotors is made chiral, such a system behaves as an autonomous thermal motor,
  converting heat currents into non-vanishing rotational ones. Such a dynamical response
  is strongly pronounced in the range of the Hamiltonian parameters for which the
  ground state of the system in the thermodynamic limit exhibits a quantum phase transition.
  Such working points are associated with large quantum coherence and multipartite
  quantum correlations within the state of the system. This suggests that the optimal
  operating regime of such quantum autonomous motor is one of maximal quantumness.

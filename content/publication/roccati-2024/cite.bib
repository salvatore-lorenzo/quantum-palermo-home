 abstract = {As light can mediate interactions between atoms in a photonic environment,engineering it for endowing the photon-mediated Hamiltonian with desiredfeatures, like robustness against disorder, is crucial in quantum research. Weprovide general theorems on the topology of photon-mediated interactions interms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological invariants, unveilingthe phenomena of topological preservation and reversal, and revealing asystem-bath topological correspondence. Depending on the Hermiticity of theenvironment and the parity of the spatial dimension, the atomic and photonictopological invariants turn out to be equal or opposite. Consequently, theemergence of atomic and photonic topological boundary modes with oppo-site group velocities in two-dimensional Hermitian topological systems isestablished. Owing to its general applicability, our results can guide the designof topological systems.},

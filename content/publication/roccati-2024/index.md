abstract: As light can mediate interactions between atoms in a photonic environment,engineering
  it for endowing the photon-mediated Hamiltonian with desiredfeatures, like robustness
  against disorder, is crucial in quantum research. Weprovide general theorems on
  the topology of photon-mediated interactions interms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian
  topological invariants, unveilingthe phenomena of topological preservation and reversal,
  and revealing asystem-bath topological correspondence. Depending on the Hermiticity
  of theenvironment and the parity of the spatial dimension, the atomic and photonictopological
  invariants turn out to be equal or opposite. Consequently, theemergence of atomic
  and photonic topological boundary modes with oppo-site group velocities in two-dimensional
  Hermitian topological systems isestablished. Owing to its general applicability,
  our results can guide the designof topological systems.

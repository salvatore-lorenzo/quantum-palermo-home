abstract: Photon-mediated interaction between quantum emitters in engineered photonic
  baths is an emerging area of quantum optics. At the same time, non-Hermitian (NH)
  physics is currently thriving, spurred by the exciting possibility to access new
  physics in systems ruled by non-trivial NH Hamiltonians---in particular, photonic
  lattices---which can challenge longstanding tenets such as the Bloch theory of bands.
  Here, we combine these two fields and study the exotic interaction between emitters
  mediated by the photonic modes of a lossy photonic lattice described by a NH Hamiltonian.
  We show in a paradigmatic case study that structured losses in the field can seed
  exotic emission properties. Photons can mediate dissipative, fully non-reciprocal
  interactions between emitters with range critically dependent on the loss rate.
  When this loss rate corresponds to a bare-lattice exceptional point, the effective
  couplings are exactly nearest neighbor, implementing a dissipative, fully non-reciprocal
  Hatano--Nelson model. Counterintuitively, this can occur irrespective of the lattice
  boundary conditions. Thus photons can mediate an effective emitter's Hamiltonian
  which is translationally invariant despite the fact that the field is not. We interpret
  these effects in terms of metastable atom--photon dressed states, which can be exactly
  localized on only two lattice cells or extended across the entire lattice. These
  findings introduce a paradigm of light-mediated interactions with unprecedented
  features such as non-reciprocity, non-trivial dependence on field boundary conditions,
  and range tunability via a loss rate.

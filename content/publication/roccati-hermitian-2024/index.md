abstract: As light can mediate interactions between atoms in a photonic environment,
  engineering it for endowing the photon-mediated Hamiltonian with desired features,
  like robustness against disorder, is crucial in quantum research. We provide general
  theorems on the topology of photon-mediated interactions in terms of both Hermitian
  and non-Hermitian topological invariants, unveiling the phenomena of topological
  preservation and reversal, and revealing a system-bath topological correspondence.
  Depending on the Hermiticity of the environment and the parity of the spatial dimension,
  the atomic and photonic topological invariants turn out to be equal or opposite.
  Consequently, the emergence of atomic and photonic topological boundary modes with
  opposite group velocities in two-dimensional Hermitian topological systems is established.
  Owing to its general applicability, our results can guide the design of topological
  systems.

abstract: 'We examine how the ability of a system to redundantly proliferate relevant
  information about its pointer states is affected when it is coupled to multiple
  baths. To this end, we consider a system in contact with two baths: one---termed
  the accessible environment ---which, on its own, induces a pure dephasing mechanism
  on the state of the system and satisfies the conditions for classical objectivity
  to be established. The second environment, which we dub as inaccessible , affects
  the system in two physically relevant ways. Firstly, we consider an interaction
  that commutes with the Hamiltonian describing the interaction between system and
  accessible bath. It thus also gives rise to dephasing of the system, albeit on different
  time scales. Secondly, we consider a thermalising interaction, which does not commute
  with the system-accessible environment Hamiltonian. While the former still allows
  the system to redundantly encode its state into the accessible environment, the
  latter degrades the correlations, eventually destroying them in the long-time limit,
  and thus leads to a loss of the conditions necessary for classical objectivity to
  be established. This sheds light on the role that commutativity between the various
  system-bath interaction terms plays when establishing the conditions for classical
  objectivity to be supported.'

abstract: The framework of Quantum Darwinism strives at characterizing the quantum-to-classical
  transition by introducing the concept of redundancy of information—as measured by
  Mutual Information—that a set of observers would acquire on the state of a physical
  system of interest. Further development on this concept, in the form of Strong Quantum
  Darwinism and Spectrum Broadcast Structures, has recently led to a more fine-grained
  identification of the nature of such information, which should not involve any quantum
  correlations between observing and observed systems, while the assessment of information
  proliferation from individual systems has attracted most of the attention so far,
  the way such mechanism takes place in more complex states is open to exploration.
  To this end, we shall consider a two-qubit state, sharing initial quantum correlations
  in the form of Quantum Discord, and different dephasing-like interactions between
  them and an observing environment. We will focus on the amount of information regarding
  the subsystem not involved in the interaction that is proliferated to the environment.
  We shall refer to this as mediated redundancy. We will show that, in some cases,
  the channel capacity of the subsystems, given these interactions, can exceed that
  of the fragments.

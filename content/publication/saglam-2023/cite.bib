 abstract = {We investigate the chiral quantum walk (CQW) as a mechanism for an entanglement transfer on a triangular chain structure. We specifically consider two-site spatially entangled cases in short-time and long-time regimes. Using the concurrence as an entanglement measure; fidelity, and the Bures distance as the measure of the quality of the state transfer, we evaluate the success of the entanglement transfer. We compare the entangled state transfer time and quality in CQW against a continuous-time quantum random walk. We also observe the effect of mixed states on the entanglement transfer quality.},

abstract: We investigate the chiral quantum walk (CQW) as a mechanism for an entanglement
  transfer on a triangular chain structure. We specifically consider two-site spatially
  entangled cases in short-time and long-time regimes. Using the concurrence as an
  entanglement measure; fidelity, and the Bures distance as the measure of the quality
  of the state transfer, we evaluate the success of the entanglement transfer. We
  compare the entangled state transfer time and quality in CQW against a continuous-time
  quantum random walk. We also observe the effect of mixed states on the entanglement
  transfer quality.

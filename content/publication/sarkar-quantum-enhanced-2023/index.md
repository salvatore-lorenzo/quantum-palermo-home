abstract: Non-Hermitian physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique
  topological features such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect.
  We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as probes for bulk
  Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity reaching Heisenberg scaling.
  Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral topological phase transition, where
  the entire spectrum undergoes a delocalization transition. We provide an explanation
  for this enhanced sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely
  non-Hermitian energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a direct
  connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the non-Hermitian
  realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic non-Hermitian
  topological models in various dimensions and potential experimental implementations.

abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework --the polarized Houston basis--
  to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for
  use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston
  states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate
  description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional
  dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto
  polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find
  that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations
  and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner
  extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation
  of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction
  of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized
  Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven
  open quantum materials.

abstract: We realize fast thermalization and state preparation of a single mode cavity
  field using a collision model-like approach, where a sequence of qubits or three
  level system ancillae, sequentially interacting with the field, is engineered with
  a genetic algorithm approach. In contrast to optimal control techniques, there is
  no time-dependent system Hamiltonian control deployed and, in contrast to reservoir
  engineering, the engineered full system-environment dynamics is optimized, and the
  target is not a steady state. We prove a significant speed up in thermalization
  - for which we show that diagonal qubit ancilla states are sufficient - and in the
  preparation of coherent states. We demonstrate the preparation of squeezed states
  and of highly non-Gaussian states. Our work offers a new alternative for fast preparation
  of cavity states that lays in between optimal Hamiltonian control and reservoir
  engineering, and gives further insights on the resources needed to realize or speed
  up the preparation of such states.

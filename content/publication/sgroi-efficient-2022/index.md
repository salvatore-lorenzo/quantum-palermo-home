abstract: We study the excitation transfer across a fully connected quantum network
  whose sites energies can be artificially designed. Starting from a simplified model
  of a Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we systematically optimize its local energies
  to achieve high excitation transfer for various environmental conditions, using
  an a daptive Gradient Descent technique and Automatic Differentiation. We show that
  almost perfect transfer can be achieved with and without local dephasing, provided
  that the dephasing rates are not too large. We investigate our solutions in terms
  of resilience against variations in either the network connection strengths, or
  size, as well as coherence losses. We highlight the different features of a dephasing-free
  and dephasing-driven transfer. Our work gives further insight into the interplay
  between coherence and dephasing effects in excitation-transfer phenomena across
  fully connected quantum networks. In turn, this will help designing optimal transfer
  in artificial open networks through the simple manipulation of local energies.

abstract: We model the dynamics of a closed quantum system brought out of mechanical
  equilibrium, undergoing a non-driven, spontaneous, thermodynamic transformation.
  In particular, we consider a quantum particle in a box with a moving and insulating
  wall, subjected to a constant external pressure. Under the assumption that the wall
  undergoes classical dynamics, we obtain a system of differential equations that
  describes the evolution of the quantum system and the motion of the wall. We study
  the dynamics of such system and the thermodynamics of the process of compression
  and expansion of the box. Our approach is able to capture several properties of
  the thermodynamic transformations considered and goes beyond a description in terms
  of an ad-hoc time-dependent Hamiltonian, considering instead the mutual interactions
  between the dynamics of the quantum system and the parameters of its Hamiltonian.

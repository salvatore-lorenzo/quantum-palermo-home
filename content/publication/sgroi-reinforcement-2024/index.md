abstract: 'We propose a bottom-up approach, based on Reinforcement Learning, to the
  design of a chain achieving efficient excitation-transfer performances. We assume
  distance-dependent interactions among particles arranged in a chain under tight-binding
  conditions. Starting from two particles and a localised excitation, we gradually
  increase the number of constitutents of the system so as to improve the transfer
  probability. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal locations and numbers
  of particles as a Markov Decision Process: we use Proximal Policy Optimization to
  find the optimal chain-building policies and the optimal chain configurations under
  different scenarios. We consider both the case in which the target is a sink connected
  to the end of the chain and the case in which the target is the right-most particle
  in the chain. We address the problem of disorder in the chain induced by particle
  positioning errors. We are able to achieve extremely high excitation transfer in
  all cases, with different chain configurations and properties depending on the specific
  conditions.'

abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light can induce a transition
  from the quantum paraelectric to the ferroelectric phase of SrTiO3. Here, we investigate
  this terahertz field-induced ferroelectric phase transition by solving the time-dependent
  lattice Schrödinger equation based on first-principles calculations. We find that
  ferroelectricity originates from a light-induced mixing between ground and first
  excited lattice states in the quantum paraelectric phase. In agreement with the
  experimental findings, our study shows that the nonoscillatory second harmonic generation
  signal can be evidence of ferroelectricity in SrTiO3. We reveal the microscopic
  details of this exotic phase transition and highlight that this phenomenon is a
  unique behavior of the quantum paraelectric phase.

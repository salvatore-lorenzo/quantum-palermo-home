abstract: We characterize the impact that the application of two maps in a quantum-controlled
  order has on the process of work extraction via unitary cycles and its optimization.
  The control is based on the quantum switch model that applies maps in an order not
  necessarily compatible with the underlying causal structure and, in principle, can
  be implemented experimentally. First, we show that the activation of quantum maps
  through the quantum switch model always entails a non-negative gain in ergotropy
  compared to their consecutive application. We also establish a condition that the
  maps should fulfill in order to achieve a non-zero ergotropic gain. We then perform
  a thorough analysis of maps applied to a two-level system and provide general conditions
  for achieving a positive gain on the incoherent part of ergotropy. Our results are
  illustrated with several examples and applied to qubit and d-dimensional quantum
  systems. In particular, we demonstrate that a non-zero work can be extracted from
  a system thermalized by two coherently controlled reservoirs.

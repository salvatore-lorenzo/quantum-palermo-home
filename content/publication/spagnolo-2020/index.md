abstract: 'The main aim of this special issue is to report recent advances and new
  trends in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of classical and quantum systems,
  from both theoretical and experimental points of view, within an interdisciplinary
  context. In particular, the nonlinear relaxation processes in the dynamics of out-of-equilibrium
  systems and the role of the metastability and environmental noise will be overviewed.
  Three main areas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics will be covered: slow relaxation
  phenomena and dissipative dynamics; long-range interactions and classical systems;
  quantum systems. New trends such as quantum thermodynamics and novel types of quantum
  phase transitions occurring in nonequilibrium steady states and topological phase
  transitions will be also highlighted. oÌ§pyright 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA

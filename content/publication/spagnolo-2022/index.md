abstract: The main aim of this special issue is to report the recent advances and
  new trends in memristors and nonequilibrium stochastic multistable systems, both
  theoretically and experimentally, within an interdisciplinary context. In particular,
  memristors are multistable systems whose switching dynamics is a stochastic process,
  which can be controlled by internal and external noise sources, unveiling the constructive
  role of random fluctuations. Furthermore, the use of memristors as memory elements
  in neuromorphic systems with noise-assisted persistence of memory states, chaotic
  dynamics, metastable chaos and chaos synchronization, new stochastic nonlinear models,
  noise-induced phenomena such as stochastic resonance, noise enhanced stability and
  phase transitions phenomena in memristors will be illustrated in the contributions
  of this special issue.

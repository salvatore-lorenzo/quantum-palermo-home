abstract: Recent developments have led to the possibility of embedding machine learning
  tools into experimental platforms to address key problems, including the characterization
  of the properties of quantum states. Leveraging on this, we implement a quantum
  extreme learning machine in a photonic platform to achieve resource-efficient and
  accurate characterization of the polarization state of a photon. The underlying
  reservoir dynamics through which such input state evolves is implemented using the
  coined quantum walk of high-dimensional photonic orbital angular momentum, and performing
  projective measurements over a fixed basis. We demonstrate how the reconstruction
  of an unknown polarization state does not need a careful characterization of the
  measurement apparatus and is robust to experimental imperfections, thus representing
  a promising route for resource-economic state characterisation.

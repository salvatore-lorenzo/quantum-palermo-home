abstract: We investigate the constructive role of an external noise signal, in the
  form of a low-rate Poisson sequence of pulses supplied to all inputs of a spiking
  neural network, consisting in maintaining for a long time or even recovering a memory
  trace (engram) of the image without its direct renewal (or rewriting). In particular,
  this unique dynamic property is demonstrated in a single-layer spiking neural network
  consisting of simple integrate-and-fire neurons and memristive synaptic weights.
  This is carried out by preserving and even fine-tuning the conductance values of
  memristors in terms of dynamic plasticity, specifically spike-timing-dependent plasticity-type,
  driven by overlapping pre- and postsynaptic voltage spikes. It has been shown that
  the weights can be to a certain extent unreliable, due to such characteristics as
  the limited retention time of resistive state or the variation of switching voltages.
  Such a noise-assisted persistence of memory, on one hand, could be a prototypical
  mechanism in a biological nervous system and, on the other hand, brings one step
  closer to the possibility of building reliable spiking neural networks composed
  of unreliable analog elements. oÌ§pyright 2021

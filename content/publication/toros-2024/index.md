abstract: Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial
  motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been
  hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were
  only \"local\" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion
  was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such
  bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by
  the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate
  the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson
  bound, thus signaling strong quantum nonlocality. Our results demonstrate that mechanical
  rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with
  implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum
  nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.

abstract: Many phenomena and fundamental predictions, ranging from Hawking radiation
  to the early evolution of the Universe rely on the interplay between quantum mechanics
  and gravity or more generally, quantum mechanics in curved spacetimes. However,
  our understanding is hindered by the lack of experiments that actually allow us
  to probe quantum mechanics in curved spacetime in a repeatable and accessible way.
  Here we propose an experimental scheme for a photon that is prepared in a path superposition
  state across two rotating Sagnac interferometers that have different diameters and
  thus represent a superposition of two different spacetimes. We predict the generation
  of genuine entanglement even at low rotation frequencies and show how these effects
  could be observed even due to the Earth's rotation. These predictions provide an
  accessible platform in which to study the role of the underlying spacetime in the
  generation of entanglement.

abstract: Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) leverage untrained quantum dynamics
  to efficiently process information encoded in input quantum states, avoiding the
  high computational cost of training more complicated nonlinear models. On the other
  hand, quantum information scrambling (QIS) quantifies how the spread of quantum
  information into correlations makes it irretrievable from local measurements. Here,
  we explore the tight relation between QIS and the predictive power of QELMs. In
  particular, we show efficient state estimation is possible even beyond the scrambling
  time, for many different types of dynamics -- in fact, we show that in all the cases
  we studied, the reconstruction efficiency at long interaction times matches the
  optimal one offered by random global unitary dynamics. These results offer promising
  venues for robust experimental QELM-based state estimation protocols, as well as
  providing novel insights into the nature of QIS from a state estimation perspective.

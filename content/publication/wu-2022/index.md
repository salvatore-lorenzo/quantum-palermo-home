abstract: Manipulating quantum systems undergoing non-Gaussian dynamics in a fast
  and accurate manner is becoming fundamental to many quantum applications. Here,
  we focus on classical and quantum protocols transferring a state across a double-well
  potential. The classical protocols are achieved by deforming the potential, while
  the quantum ones are assisted by a counter-diabatic driving. We show that quantum
  protocols perform more quickly and accurately. Finally, we design a figure of merit
  for the performance of the transfer protocols -- namely, the emphprotocol grading
  -- that depends only on fundamental physical quantities, and which accounts for
  the quantum speed limit, the fidelity and the thermodynamic of the process. We test
  the protocol grading with classical and quantum protocols, and show that quantum
  protocols have higher protocol grading than the classical ones.

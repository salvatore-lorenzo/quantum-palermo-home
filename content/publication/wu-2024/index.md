abstract: 'Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and
  quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be generated
  via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle. However, the
  amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental environmental
  effects. We analyze the performance of a scheme that, by embedding careful time-control
  of trapping potentials and fully accounting for the most relevant sources of noise
  -- including measurement backaction -- achieves significant levels of mechanical
  squeezing. The feasibility of our proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art,
  makes it a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. '

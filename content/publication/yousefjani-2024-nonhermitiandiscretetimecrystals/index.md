abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTC) exhibit a special non-equilibrium phase of
  matter in periodically driven many-body systems with spontaneous breaking of time
  translational symmetry. The presence of decoherence generally enhances thermalization
  and destroys the coherence required for the existence of DTC. In this letter, we
  devise a mechanism for establishing a stable DTC with period-doubling oscillations
  in an open quantum system that is governed by a properly tailored non-Hermitian
  Hamiltonian. We find a specific class of non-reciprocal couplings in our non-Hermitian
  dynamics which prevents thermalization through eigenstate ordering. Such choice
  of non-Hermitian dynamics, significantly enhances the stability of the DTC against
  imperfect pulses. Through a comprehensive analysis, we determine the phase diagram
  of the system in terms of pulse imperfection.

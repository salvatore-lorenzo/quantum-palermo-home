 abstract = {Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been harnessed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark models, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating the strength of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields. The problem naturally lies in the context of multi-parameter estimation. We determine the phase diagram of the system in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the extended phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. We also characterize the properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, through a comprehesive finite-size scaling analysis. Interestingly, our results show that the estimation of both the linear and the nonlinear fields can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling. In fact, the scaling exponent of the sensing precision is directly proportional to the nonlinearity exponent which shows that nonlinearity enhances the estimation precision. Finally, we show that even after considering the cost of the preparation time the sensing precision still reveals super-Heisenberg scaling.},

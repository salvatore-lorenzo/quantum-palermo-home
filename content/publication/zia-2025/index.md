abstract: Accurately estimating properties of quantum states, such as entanglement,
  while essential for the development of quantum technologies, remains a challenging
  task. Standard approaches to property estimation rely on detailed modeling of the
  measurement apparatus and a priori assumptions on their working principles. Even
  small deviations can greatly affect reconstruction accuracy and prediction reliability.
  Here, we demonstrate that quantum reservoir computing embodies a powerful alternative
  for witnessing quantum entanglement and, more generally, estimating quantum features
  from experimental data. We leverage the orbital angular momentum of photon pairs
  as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable informationally complete single-setting
  measurements of their polarization. Our approach does not require fine-tuning or
  refined knowledge of the setup, at the same time outperforming conventional approaches.
  It automatically adapts to noise and imperfections while avoiding overfitting, ensuring
  robust reconstruction of entanglement witnesses and paving the way to the assessment
  of quantum features of experimental multiparty states. A quantum reservoir uses
  photon OAM to witness entanglement without modeling, enabling robust, efficient,
  single-setting analysis.

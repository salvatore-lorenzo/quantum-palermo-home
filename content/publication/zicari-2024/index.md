abstract: The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in terms of entropy production,
  which can be used to quantify the degree of irreversibility of a process. In this
  Chapter, we consider the standard scenario of open quantum systems, where a system
  irreversibly interacts with an external environment. We show that the standard approach,
  based on von Neumann entropy, can be replaced by a phase-space formulation of the
  problem. In particular, we focus on spin systems that can be described using the
  so-called spin coherent states. We deploy this formalism to study the interplay
  between the entropy production rate and the initial quantum coherence available
  to the system.

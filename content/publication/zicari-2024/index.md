abstract: Spontaneous collapse models, which are phenomenological mechanisms introduced
  and designed to account for dynamical wavepacket reduction, are attracting a growing
  interest from the community interested in the characterisation of the quantum-to-classical
  transition. Here, we introduce a ıt quantum-probing approach to the quest of deriving
  metrological upper bounds on the free parameters of such empirical models. To illustrate
  our approach, we consider an extended quantum Ising chain whose elements are --
  either individually or collectively -- affected by a mechanism responsible for spontaneous
  collapse. We explore configurations involving out-of-equilibrium states of the chain,
  which allows us to infer information about the collapse mechanism before it is completely
  scrambled from the state of the system. Moreover, we investigate potential amplification
  effects on the probing performance based on the exploitation of quantum criticality.

abstract: Abstract Recent studies have pointed out the intrinsic dependence of figures
  of merit of thermodynamic relevance—such as work, heat and entropy production—on
  the amount of quantum coherences that is made available to a system. However, whether
  coherences hinder or enhance the value taken by such quantifiers of thermodynamic
  performance is yet to be ascertained. We show that, when considering entropy production
  generated in a process taking a finite-size bipartite quantum system out of equilibrium
  through local non-unitary channels, no general monotonicity relationship exists
  between the entropy production and degree of quantum coherence in the state of the
  system. A direct correspondence between such quantities can be retrieved when considering
  specific forms of open-system dynamics applied to suitably chosen initial states.
  Our results call for a systematic study of the role of genuine quantum features
  in the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum processes.

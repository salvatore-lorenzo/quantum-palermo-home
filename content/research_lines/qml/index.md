          Quantum machine learning studies the intersection between machine learning and quantum information theory, focusing both on how quantum computation can speed-up tasks typically handle by machine learning, and how classical machine learning can further our understanding of quantum information science. <p>
          It is a vast interdisciplinary field that encompasses many different lines of study. We focus in particular on the study of quantum extreme learning machines and quantum reservoir computers, a class of quantum machine learning techniques that promises great potential, while also remaining a simple enough model to allow reaching many theoretical insights into what might make quantum speed-ups at all possible.

  #        <p>Quantum Information Theory explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and information theory. At its core are qubits, #quantum counterparts to classical bits, which can exist in superpositions and entangled states. Superposition enables #parallel computations, while entanglement provides unique correlations between particles. Quantum gates manipulate qubits, #forming the basis for quantum computing and algorithms. <p>
  #        This interdisciplinary field encompasses quantum cryptography, communication, and sensing. Challenges include mitigating #decoherence, implementing error correction, and bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications. Quantum #Information Theory promises revolutionary advancements in computation, communication security, and precision measurement.
